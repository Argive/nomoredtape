HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO 
RULES 
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system– 
Title Division Chapter Rule 
3 CSR 10- 4 .115 Department Code of Agency General area Specific area 
State Division regulated regulated Regulations 
and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115. 
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a. 
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation, for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115 NOT Rule 10-4.115. Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated.

April 2, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 7 
Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2220—State Board of Pharmacy Chapter 4—Fees Charged by the Board of Pharmacy 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2220-4.010 General Fees. The Board of Pharmacy is propos- 
ing to amend subsection (1)(D) and delete section (5). 
PURPOSE: The Board of Pharmacy is statutorily obligated to enforce and administer the provisions of Chapter 338, RSMo, governing the practice of pharmacy. Pursuant to section 338.070, RSMo, the board shall set the appropriate amount of fees by rule, so that the revenue produced shall not substantially exceed the cost and expense of administering the provisions of Chapter 338, RSMo. Based on the board’s five- (5-) year projections, the board finds it necessary to reduce renewal fees for Missouri licensed pharmacists. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The Board of Pharmacy is statutorily obligated to set all fees, by regulation, necessary to administer the provisions of Chapter 338, RSMo. Pursuant to section 338.070, RSMo, the board shall set the appropriate amount of fees by rule, so that the revenue produced shall not substantially exceed the cost and expense of administering the provisions of Chapter 338, RSMo. Therefore, the board is proposing to decrease 2018 renewal fees for Missouri pharmacists from two hundred dollars ($200) to one hun- 
dred dollars ($100). Pharmacist renewal notices will be mailed on August 1, 2018. Without this emergency amendment, the decreased fee requirements will not be effective prior to mailing and the board will collect more revenue than it is statutorily authorized to collect. The scope of the emergency amendment is limited to the circum- stances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. In devel- oping this emergency amendment, the board has determined that the fee decrease is necessary for the 2018 renewal period to prevent funds from exceeding the maximum fund balance thereby resulting in a transfer from the fund to general revenue as set forth in section 338.070.3, RSMo. Pursuant to section 324.001.10, RSMo, a com- pelling governmental interest is deemed to exist for the purposes of section 536.025, RSMo, for licensure fees to be reduced by emer- gency rule, if the projected fund balance of any agency assigned to the Division of Professional Registration is reasonably expected to exceed an amount that would require transfer from that fund to gen- eral revenue. The board believes this emergency amendment to be fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency amendment was filed February 16, 2018, becomes effec- tive March 30, 2018, and expires January 9, 2019. 
(1) The following fees are established by the State Board of Pharmacy: (D) Pharmacist License Renewal Fee $200 
1. Effective from August 1, 2018 through October 31, 2018 $100 
[(5) To ensure compliance with section 338.070, RSMo, the following renewal fees shall be effective from August 1, 2017 to October 31, 2017: 
(A) Pharmacy Distributor/Wholesale Drug Distributor License Renewal Fee $150 
(B) Pharmacy Permit Renewal Fee $150] 
AUTHORITY: sections 338.020, 338.035, 338.040, 338.060, 338.070, 338.140, 338.185, 338.220, 338.230, 338.270, 338.280, 338.335, and 338.350, RSMo 2016. This rule originally filed as 4 CSR 220-4.010. Emergency rule filed July 15, 1981, effective Aug. 3, 1981, expired Nov. 11, 1981. Original rule filed Aug. 10, 1981, effec- tive Nov. 12, 1981. For intervening history, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Emergency amendment filed Feb. 16, 2018, effective March 30, 2018, expires Jan. 9, 2019. A proposed amend- ment covering this same material is published in this issue of the Missouri Register.

MISSOURI Proposed Rules April 2, 2018 REGISTER Vol. 43, No. 7 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]

2 CSR 90-30.040 Quality Standards for Motor Fuels. The director is amending the summary statement, subsections (1)(C), (1)(E), and (1)(F), and deleting subsections (1)(G)–(1)(K). 
PURPOSE: This amendment will update the summary statement by removing obsolete designation numbers which conflict with state statute 414.032, RSMo, removes the sunset date on the vapor pres- sure exemption allowed for ethanol blended gasoline, removes obso- lete terms used for gasoline grades and octane rating for premium that conflict with state statute 414.255, RSMo, and removes more obsolete designation numbers which conflict with state statute 414.032, RSMo. 
SUMMARY: [American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Designation: D 4814-88a addresses standard specifi- cations for the properties of automotive spark-ignition engine fuel. ASTM Designation: No. D 910-88a addresses standard specifications for the properties of aviation gasoline. ASTM Designation: D 1655-88a addresses standard specifications for the properties of aviation turbine fuel. ASTM Designation: D 975-88 addresses standard specifications for the properties of all diesel fuel. ASTM Designation: D 396-86 addresses standard specifications for the properties of all fuel oils. ASTM Designation: D 3699-88 addresses standard specifica- tions for the properties of all kerosene. The number immedi- ately following the designated specification number indicates the year of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision.] ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) addresses standard specifications for kerosene, diesel fuel, heating oil, avia- tion turbine fuel, gasoline, gasoline-alcohol blends, and other motor fuels. Missouri references the most current edition of ASTM specifications as Missouri law (Chapter 414.032 RSMo).

PURPOSE: This amendment changes the rule title, updates terminol- ogy and purchasing processes, and removes unnecessary language.

The delega- tion of authority requires the department to comply with the basic intent of public procurement procedures to purchase the services. 
(1) As set out in sections 34.100 and 630.405, RSMo, the commis- sioner of administration has delegated his/her authority to the depart- ment to purchase services from providers directly rather than through the Division of Purchasing of the Office of Administration.

In so designating entities, the director may take into account, but shall not be limited to, the fol- lowing: the ability of the entity to provide, subcontract or develop the necessary array of services, the stability of the entity as indicated by its historical service provision, the community-based nature of the service, the ability of the entity to utilize funding to maximize division-identified ser- vices to the greatest number of clients with quality and effective service] for the purchase of services for individuals served by the Division of Behavioral Health and the Division of Developmental Disabilities as defined in section 630.407, RSMo. 
[(3) The noncompetitive negotiation procedure shall be used when the department director designates an affiliated com- munity service provider. 
(4) The noncompetitive negotiation procedure shall be used to establish contracts for the Division of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities’ Purchase of Service pro- grams.] 
(3) As set out in section 630.407, RSMo, the department may contract directly with administrative entities without competitive bids. 
AUTHORITY: sections 34.100, [and] 630.050, [RSMo 2000] and 630.405, RSMo [Supp. 2003] 2016. Original rule filed Oct. 16, 1986, effective July 13, 1987. For intervening history, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Amended: Filed Feb. 23, 2018.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
9 CSR 25-2.305 [Request for Proposal] Invitation for Bid Solicitation Procedures. The department is amending the rule title and purpose, deleting sections (1)–(12), and adding a new section (1). 
PURPOSE: This amendment changes the rule title and removes lan- guage related to request for proposal as this process has been replaced by invitation for bid. 
PURPOSE: This rule prescribes department procedures for soliciting [offerors] bidders in response to [requests for a proposal] an invitation for bid for services which require a competitive bid. 
[(1) The department shall specify in each request for a pro- posal (RFP) the proposal closing time, date and place to pro- vide offerors a reasonable time to prepare their proposals. 
(2) The department shall post notices of the availability of the RFPs in the department’s central office contracts unit. The department shall mail or otherwise distribute the RFPs or notices of the availability of the RFPs. 
(A) If a purchase involves the estimated expenditure of more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), the department shall advertise the notice of availability of the RFP in two (2) newspapers of general circulation in the geo- graphic area where the services are to be provided or in places as are most likely to reach prospective sources. 
(B) The department shall make a copy of each RFP avail- able for public inspection at the department’s central office contracts unit. 
(3) The department may issue amendments for any modifi- cation(s) of the RFP. The department shall plainly mark any RFP amendment as such and shall reference the portions of the RFP it amends. 
(4) Offerors may modify or withdraw proposals in writing in a notice to the department at the location designated in the RFP before the proposal closing time and date. The depart- ment shall keep any modification or withdrawal documenta- tion in the RFP file. 
(5) When the procurement requires the utilization of compet- itive evaluation, the formal RFP solicitation method should be utilized. 
(A) Proposals should be received in a sealed container by the time set forth for the opening of the proposals. 
(B) Proposals received after the time set forth for the opening of proposals shall be considered late and will not be opened. 
(C) Under extraordinary circumstances, the department may authorize the opening of a late proposal. In such cases, the proposal must have been turned over to the physical control of an independent postal or courier service with promised delivery time prior to the time set forth for the opening of the proposals. All such decisions are at the sole discretion of the department. The following guidelines may be utilized to deter- mine the criteria for an extraordinary circumstance: 
1. State offices were closed due to inclement weather conditions; 
2. Postal or courier services were delayed due to labor strikes or unforeseen “Acts of God”; and 
3. Postal or courier service did not meet delivery time 
promised to the offeror. In such case, the offeror must pro- vide written proof that the promised delivery time was prior to the time set forth for the opening of the proposals. 
(D) Proposals received in response to an RFP shall not be available for public review until after a contract is executed or all proposals are rejected. 
(6) The department shall keep records of each late proposal, modification(s) or withdrawal in the RFP file. 
(7) The department shall open proposals and modifications publicly at the time and date as specified in the RFP. 
(8) In the event the department receives a container which is not identifiable as a specific proposal, an authorized per- son within the department may open the container to deter- mine its contents. If the contents are determined to be a pro- posal, the container will be resealed and the solicitation number, opening date, and time will be noted on the outside. The container will then be filed until the official time for opening. 
(9) After the proposal opening, an offeror may be permitted to withdraw a proposal prior to award at the sole discretion of the department, if there is a verifiable error in the propos- al, and enforcement of the proposal would impose an uncon- scionable hardship on the offeror. The withdrawal will be considered only after receipt of a written request and sup- porting documentation from the offeror. Withdrawal shall be the offeror’s sole remedy for an error other than an obvious clerical error. 
(10) If mistakes in proposals are discovered after the propos- al closing time and date but before award, the following pro- cedures shall apply. The department may allow the offeror to correct minor informalities which are matters of form rather than substance or insignificant mistakes correctable without unfair advantage to the offeror. 
(11) The department shall issue a determination in writing granting or denying requests to modify or withdraw propos- als because of a mistake. 
(12) Contracts awarded as a result of a competitive solicita- tion may be amended when such an amendment is in the best interest of the department and does not significantly alter the original intent or scope of the contract.] 
(1) The department complies with Office of Administration, Division of Purchasing rules, regulations, and requirements related to the Invitation for Bid (IFB) process as set out in Chapter 34, RSMo, 1 CSR 40, the state procurement manual, and Division of Purchasing policies and procedures.

(A) All clients shall complete a valid and reliable screening instrument approved by the department to identify problem users. The screening instrument shall be standardized, con- sistent statewide, and interpreted by certified qualified sub- stance abuse professionals who are properly supervised and trained in the use of the screening device.
