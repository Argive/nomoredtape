HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO 
RULES 
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system– 
Title Division Chapter Rule 
3 CSR 10- 4 .115 Department Code of Agency General area Specific area 
State Division regulated regulated Regulations 
and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115. 
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a. 
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation, for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115 NOT Rule 10-4.115. Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated.

Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2245—Real Estate Appraisers Chapter 5—Fees 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2245-5.020 Application, Certificate and License Fees. 
The commission is amending section (2). 
PURPOSE: This amendment sets forth the required fees assessed to appraisal management companies per Policy Statement 8 issued by the Appraisal Subcommittee in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: This emergency amendment is neces- sary to preserve a compelling governmental interest requiring an early effective date of the rule by informing the public of a new fee relating to appraisal management companies. The proposal outlines the twenty-five dollar ($25) annual registry fee to be paid by Appraisal Management Companies (AMC) for each appraiser who completes a covered transaction within a given year. This is a result of the Dodd-Frank Act signed in 2010 by the president which required the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) to maintain a national registry of appraisal management companies that are under the supervision of a state appraiser licensing agency or operating subsidiary of a federally regulated financial institution. 
The Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions 
Examination Council (ASC) adopted a final rule pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 3353, to implement collection and transmission of federal appraisal management company (AMC) annual registry fees to be collected per the federal Dodd-Frank Act by all state appraiser certi- fying and licensing agencies, including the Missouri Real Estate Appraisers Commission (commission). The final rule became effec- tive on November 24, 2017. The ASC gave the states the flexibility to determine the twelve- (12-) month reporting period and collecting period for the annual registry fee. The commission elected to collect the registry fee during the biennial licensure renewal period which starts April 1, 2018. The commission will collect the registry fee bien- nially thereafter. The collected registry fees are submitted to the ASC for Missouri AMCs to be eligible for the AMC Registry. It is very important that Missouri AMCs be on this national registry to assign appraisals to appraisers in conjunction with federally related trans- actions. If not listed on the national registry, Missouri AMC’s would not be able to perform these functions and lose out on this business. 
The scope of the emergency amendment is limited to the circum- stances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. In devel- oping this emergency amendment, the commission has determined that if the fee is not collected then appraisal management companies would not be able to conduct business involving a federally related transaction in Missouri. In addition, pursuant to section 339.509, RSMo the commission shall, “ define by regulation, with respect to each category of trainee, state certified real estate appraiser, and state licensed real estate appraisers and for appraisal management companies, the type of educational experience, appraisal experience and equivalent experience, and other criteria that will meet the statu- tory requirements of sections 339.500 to 339.549 or as required by federal law or regulation, provided that such standards shall be equivalent to the minimum criteria for certification and licensure issued by the appraiser qualifications board of the appraisal founda- tion and the provisions of 339.517 or as required by federal law and regulations.” The division believes this emergency amendment to be fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency amendment was filed March 5, 2018, becomes effec- tive March 15, 2018, and expires September 10, 2018. 
(2) The following fees shall be paid by appraisal management com- panies (AMC) for original application, issuance, and renewal of license: 
(B) License Renewal Fee 
1. Federal AMC covered transactions (per appraiser) 
(F) Appraisal Subcommittee Fee (per appraiser) 
$350 
$ 25* $ 25** 
*For those AMCs that meet the federal definition of AMC as defined in 12 U.S.C. 3350(11): an additional twenty-five dol- lars ($25) multiplied by the number of appraisers who have performed an appraisal for the AMC in connection with a cov- ered transaction during the previous two (2) years shall be remitted. 
**Appraisal management companies that are owned and con- trolled by an insured depository institution as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813 and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are to remit a check made payable to the Appraisal Subcommittee by June 30th of even numbered years. The amount to be remitted shall be determined by multiplying the number of appraisers who have performed an appraisal for the AMC in connection with a covered transaction by twenty-five dollars ($25) for each of the previous two (2) years.

Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]

However, this presumption is rebut- table, and can be rebutted by evidence demonstrating that a person not paying the transportation charges actually con- trols the selection of the carrier and the routing of the ship- ment, who would be presumed to be the shipper in such an instance.

Proposed Rules 
April 16, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 8 
(F) Loose materials, such as coal, sand, scrap iron, and the like, may not be stored or piled adjacent to a railroad track with a hori- zontal clearance at any point less than eight feet six inches (8'6") from the center of track, measured at right angle to, except as pro- vided in this rule. A guard or retainer to hold the loose materials may be constructed with a horizontal clearance of not less than eight feet six inches (8'6") from the center line of track, measured at a right angle to the center. The horizontal clearance of eight feet six inches (8'6") shall be maintained to a retainer or guard height of sixteen feet (16') above the level of the top of rail. Along a freight track not in open thoroughfare, a retainer or guard, the top of which is approxi- mately level with the floor of freight cars, may be constructed adja- cent to but one (1) side of the track with a horizontal clearance of less than eight feet six inches (8'6") but not less than five feet nine inches (5'9") to the center line of track, measured at a right angle to the center, provided that in every such case warning signs shall be erected at a suitable location at each end of the retainer or guard directing the trainmen’s attention to the insufficient clearance and prohibiting trainmen from riding the sides of cars while in motion. No individual, partnership, association, or corporation [shall] may store or pile loose material adjacent to a railroad track unless a retainer or guard with the clearances prescribed is erected, or unless, immediately after the piling of this material all such material not pro- viding a clearance of eight feet six inches (8'6") to the center line of adjacent railroad tracks [shall be] is removed. Retainers or guards constructed to hold the loose materials shall not have a horizontal clearance less than the prescribed minimum in this subsection, unless permission has been received from the division to vary. This subsec- tion [shall] does not apply to individuals, partnerships, corporations, trustees, or receivers owning or operating a railroad while engaged in the construction, maintenance, or repair of a railroad track or other structure; 
(G) No railroad track unless specifically authorized by the [D]divi- sion [of Transportation], shall be constructed after July 1, 1985 so that the center line of track is less than fourteen feet (14') from the center line of an adjacent track and no ladder track shall be con- structed so that the center line of the ladder track is less than nineteen feet (19') from the center line of an adjacent ladder track or less than seventeen feet (17') from the center line of any other track. Any sys- tem of three (3) or more tracks at freight houses, warehouses, wharves, or similar structures, used exclusively for handling freight to or from platforms located on one (1) or both sides, may have track center distances of thirteen feet (13'), provided that at least two (2) tracks in one such system shall have centers not less than thirteen feet six inches (13'6") provided that no track having track center dis- tances of less than fourteen feet (14') shall be used as a thoroughfare track. The distance between tracks may be diminished to the extent necessary for the construction of crossings, crossovers, gauntlet tracks, turnouts, switches, or radial tracks. The provisions requiring fourteen feet (14') distances between track centers [shall] do not apply [to the construction of tracks in yards now under con- struction nor] to the construction of tracks under viaducts or other overpasses which originally were designed to accommodate an addi- tional track(s) at distances of less than fourteen feet (14') between track centers, if under that design the additional track(s) cannot be constructed with a distance between track centers of fourteen feet (14'). Permission to construct tracks with less clearance may be granted by the [D]division [of Transportation] if, after a thorough investigation [and hearing] in any particular case, it is determined that the construction would not create a condition unduly hazardous to railroad employees or other persons; 
(H) At locations where low switch stands and dwarf signals are placed between tracks having track center distances of fourteen feet (14') or less, the horizontal clearance rule contained in subsection (2)(A) [shall] appl[y]ies; and 
(I) The horizontal clearances specified [shall] do not apply to automatic train stop wayside inductors provided the inductor does not extend more than three inches (3") above the level of the top of rail 
and is not less than four feet two inches (4'2") from the center of track[; and]. 
[(J) The horizontal clearances specified shall not apply to mail cranes provided the top arm of the mail crane when in position to support mail sacks for delivery is not above a point which is ten feet eight inches (10’8”) above top of rail and does not extend within six feet five inches (6’5”) from the center of track.]

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
[4]7 CSR 265-8.080 Railroad-Highway Grade Crossing Warning Systems. The Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission is moving the rule to Title 7 and deleting the marking diagrams, amend- ing sections (1), (3), and (4), deleting section (2), and renumbering sections (3) and (4). 
PURPOSE: This amendment moves the rule from Title 4 to Title 7, updates the references to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) guidelines and the federal regulations in 49 CFR Part 234 that are incorporated into this rule. The amendment also 
removes a pavement marking diagram as part of the published rule because this diagram is included in Part 8 of the MUTCD. 
PUBLISHER’S NOTE: The secretary of state has determined that the publication of the entire text of the material which is incorporated by reference as a portion of this rule would be unduly cumbersome or expensive. This material as incorporated by reference in this rule shall be maintained by the agency at its headquarters and shall be made available to the public for inspection and copying at no more than the actual cost of reproduction. This note applies only to the ref- erence material. The entire text of the rule is printed here.

This rule does not incorporate any subsequent amendments or addi- tions of this manual. Part [VIII] 8, entitled “Traffic Control [Systems for Railroads-Highway Grade Crossing] for Railroad and Light Rail Transit Grade Crossings” establishes standards for the design, installation, and operation of grade crossing warning devices. [The Division of Transportation recommends that the standards in Part VIII be applied in the installation of all grade crossing warning systems in Missouri.] Unless a specific variance is granted by the division, the standards in Part 8 must be applied in the installation of all grade crossing warning sys- tems in Missouri, except that only twelve- (12-) inch diameter lenses shall be used on flashing light signal units. 
[(2) The division director finds it necessary to incorporate by reference in this rule Part VIII of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) (1988 Edition), with the following changes:

8B-10 Crossing Inventory Number 
The proper DOT/AAR crossing inventory number shall be dis- played in a conspicuous location at each grade crossing; 
(B) The sixth paragraph as contained in paragraph 8C-7 on page 8C-10 is deleted. This paragraph reads as follows: “Two sizes of lenses, 8-inch diameter and 12-inch diameter, are available for flashing light signal units. The larger lens provides somewhat better visibility. In choosing between the sizes of lenses, consideration should be given to the princi- ples stated in section 4B-A for choosing between the 8-inch and 12-inch lenses for use in highway intersection traffic control signals.’’; 
(C) The following paragraph is added immediately after paragraph 8C-7 on page 8C-10: 
8C-8 Lens Dimensions 
Only 12-inch diameter lenses shall be used on flashing light signal units, unless a specific exemption is granted by the division; and 
(D) The following supplement to Figure 8-2 is added immediately after Figure 8-2 on Page 8B-4:] 
[(3)](2) [After December 9, 1991, w]Whenever one (1) or more adjacent tracks (but fewer than all tracks), are physically removed from a grade crossing, or physically removed, except through a grade

[The railroad(s) shall complete the relo- cation of the warning devices (whether active or passive) within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of actual removal of the track, unless otherwise ordered by the division.] 
[(4)](3) [The division adopts the requirements governing the safety of highway-rail grade crossing signal systems as adopted by the Federal Railroad Administration and pub- lished in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, part 234— Grade Crossing Signal System Safety, on October 1, 1997, and subsequent final rules published in the Federal Register, except that the division does not adopt the provisions of Appendix A to Part 234—Schedule of Civil Penalties, or any other provision the adoption of which would exceed the statutory authority of this division. These regulations include safety requirements relating to the reporting of signal system malfunctions, responding to such reports, and maintaining, inspecting and testing grade crossing signal systems.] The provisions governing the safety of highway-rail grade crossing sig- nal systems published in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 234, but not including Appendix A – Schedule of Penalties, are incorporated by reference and made a part of this rule as published October 1, 2016 by the Federal Railroad Administration, United States Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590.

Title 9—DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH Division 10—Director, Department of Mental Health Chapter 1—Organization and Description 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 9 CSR 10-1.010 General Organization. The department is amend- 
ing the purpose and sections (1) and (4)–(7). 
PURPOSE: This amendment updates the descriptions of the organi- zation of the department and where the public may obtain informa- tion about the department as required by section 536.023, RSMo 2016. 
PURPOSE: This rule describes the organization of the department and where the public may obtain information about the department as required by section 536.023, RSMo [1986]. 
(1) The Department of Mental Health (DMH) was established by the Omnibus Reorganization Act of 1974. Under Chapter 630, RSMo the department shall administer, maintain, and develop facilities and services for persons affected by mental disorders, developmental dis- abilities, and alcohol or drug abuse. The department further seeks to reduce the incidence and prevalence of disabling conditions; to sys- tematically plan on a regional and statewide basis for the provision 
of services; to certify or license, or both, certain residential facilities, day programs, and specialized services; to conduct research and pro- gram evaluation to improve services; and to develop staff and analyze mental health manpower needs. 
(4) The department service delivery system is divided into the fol- lowing [three (3)] two (2) divisions as described in other rules of this title: the Division of [Alcohol and Drug Abuse, the Division of Comprehensive Psychiatric Services] Behavioral Health and the Division of [Mental Retardation and] Developmental Disabilities. 
[(A) The Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse plans and funds prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programs for persons who have alcohol or chemical dependencies. It pro- vides community-based funding for prevention, outpatient, residential and detoxification services. The division also pro- vides technical assistance to agencies and sets standards for treatment programs, qualified professionals and alcohol- and drug-related educational programs. The division also pro- vides outpatient treatment services to compulsive gamblers and their families. The division’s phone number is (573) 751-4942.] 
[(B)](A) The Division of [Comprehensive Psychiatric Services has three (3) primary roles in the delivery of public sector psychiatric services. As a direct provider of services, the division operates eleven (11) facilities that provide acute and long-term inpatient psychiatric care of adults and chil- dren, inpatient forensic services, and a specialized treatment center for civilly committed sex offenders. In its role as pur- chaser and regulator, the division contracts with private not- for-profit mental health agencies to provide a comprehensive range of community-based psychiatric services and supports for adults and children. For persons with mental illness who require housing assistance and supports, the division autho- rizes service delivery through contracts with privately oper- ated residential providers across the state. Standards and outcomes for community-based and residential service deliv- ery as well as financial performance requirements are codi- fied in policies, regulation, rules, and contracts. These accountability requirements are monitored periodically by division and department staff conducting on-site reviews and analysis of financial and service delivery encounters and outcomes.] Behavioral Health provides comprehensive mental health and substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery services. The division oversees state-operated facilities for people with serious mental illnesses and children with severe emo- tional disturbances. Community-based treatment is provided through contracted, certified agencies that serve children, youth, and adults. Recovery services support individuals in recovery from serious mental illness or substance use disorders. Prevention ser- vices are provided through a network of contracted, certified agen- cies that offer education and early intervention activities for chil- dren, youth, and families. Prevention Resource Centers are the primary source of technical assistance for local communities. 
[(C)](B) The Division of [Mental Retardation and] Developmental Disabilities serves a population that has such develop- mental disabilities as [mental retardation,] cerebral palsy, head injury, autism, epilepsy, and [other related] certain learning disabil- ities. [Mental retardation must have occurred before age eigh- teen (18) while all other conditions] Such conditions must have been manifested before age twenty-two (22) with the expectation that they will [be lifelong] continue. To be eligible for services from the division, persons with these disabilities must have substantial function- al limitations in two (2) or more of the following areas of major life activities: self-care, [communication] receptive and expressive lan- guage development and use, learning, [decision-making] self- direction, capacity for independent living or economic self-sufficien- cy, and mobility. This division’s primary mission is to assist persons 

Page 772 
Proposed Rules 
April 16, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 8 
with developmental disabilities through programs and services to enable those persons to live independently and productively.[, given their individual needs and capabilities. The division achieves its mission through a statewide system of seventeen (17) state-operated facilities that provide or purchase specialized services. The eleven (11) regional centers form the frame- work for the system, backed by six (6) habilitation centers that provide residential care and habilitation services for peo- ple with the most severe disabilities. The regional centers, the primary points of entry into the system, provide assess- ment and case management services. The centers also pro- vide oversight for and quality enhancement support for pro- grams/services funded by the division.] 
(5) The department provides administrative and technical support for the entire department and its divisions through the following units. 
(A) The [Office] Division of Administration[, headed by the department’s deputy director for administration,] provides a range of administrative and financial services to help the department achieve effective results. The office’s services can be divided into the following areas: 
1. [Fiscal management accounts for all funds, manages expenditures and produces fiscal summaries, analyses, and reports] Budget and Finance; 
2. [Capitol improvements/general services provides guid- ance on construction, maintenance and repair for twenty- seven (27) state-owned facilities, and coordinates leases] Accounting; 
3. [Contracts management secures more than four thou- sand five hundred (4,500) private agencies or individuals to provide services in the community] Purchasing and General Services; and 
4. [Reimbursements collects payments from private insur- ance, Medicaid and Medicare, and private pay for department services;] Medicaid Reimbursements. 
[5. Budget services develops and monitors the annual operating and lease budgets and oversees spending plans; 
6. Revenue management maximizes all available revenue streams to effectively manage financial resources; and

Title 4—DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Division 240—Public Service Commission Chapter 3—Filing and Reporting Requirements 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Public Service Commission under sec- tions 386.040, 386.250, 393.140, 393.290, and 393.291, RSMo 2016, the commission rescinds a rule as follows: 
4 CSR 240-3.050 Small Utility Rate Case Procedure is rescinded. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the proposed rescission was published in the Missouri Register on November 15, 2017 (42 MoReg 1641). No changes have been made in the proposed rescis- sion, so it is not reprinted here. The proposed rescission becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended December 15, 2017, and the commission held a public hearing on the proposed rescission on December 21, 2017. The commission did not receive any written comments about the rescission, and no one offered a comment about the rescission at the public hearing. 
Title 4—DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Division 240—Public Service Commission Chapter 10—Utilities 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Public Service Commission under sec- tions 386.040, 386.250, 393.140, 393.290, and 393.291, RSMo 2016, the commission adopts a rule as follows: 
4 CSR 240-10.075 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on November 15, 2017 (42 MoReg 1641–1643). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after pub- lication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended December 15, 2017, and the commission held a public hearing on the proposed rule on December 21, 2017. The commission received timely written comments from the Office of the Public Counsel and from the staff of the commission. Jacob Westen, representing the commission’s staff and Natelle Dietrich on behalf of staff, as well as Ryan Smith representing the Office of the Public Counsel and Keri Roth on behalf of Public Counsel, appeared at the hearing and offered comments. Both staff and Public Counsel offered comments about the specific provisions of the proposed rule. Those comments will be addressed in relation to those provisions. 
COMMENT #1: Public Counsel suggested the definition of “small utility” found in subsection (1)(A) be modified to limit application of this rule to smaller, less sophisticated, utilities. RESPONSE: The proposed rule defines a small utility, to which the procedures described in the rule would apply, as a gas utility serving ten thousand (10,000) or fewer customers, a water or sewer utility serving eight thousand (8,000) or fewer customers, or a steam utility serving one hundred (100) or fewer customers. As a practical matter there are currently no gas utilities or steam utilities in Missouri that meet the definition of a small utility so the rule will affect only small water and sewer utilities at this time. As Public Counsel indicates, some utilities that meet the definition of “small utilities” are more financially and operationally sophisticated than others. Some are, in fact subsidiaries of multi-national corporations. However, there is no clear number of customers that would delineate an unsophisticated from a sophisticated small utility. The customer numbers used to define a small utility in this rule are derived from the definitions of small utilities found in current Missouri statutes. No change will be made in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #2: Staff proposed to change the definition of “disposi- tion agreement” to clarify that a disposition agreement has the same force and effect as a “stipulation and agreement” as that term is gen- erally used in practice before the commission. Public Counsel indi- cated it does not oppose that change. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with the proposed clarification and will adopt the revised language proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #3: Public Counsel notes that the existing Small Utility Rate Case Procedure rule includes a provision that would allow the commission to summarily dismiss a small utility’s request for rate relief if it fails to timely provide staff or Public Counsel with the information needed to investigate that request. It suggests that provi- sion should be retained in this rule. 
RESPONSE: The commission does not believe a provision for sum- mary dismissal for failure to provide information is either necessary or workable in practice. No change will be made in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #4: Public Counsel is concerned that subsection (3)(B), which allows a small utility rate case to be commenced by the filing 
788 
 
April 16, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 8 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 789 

of a complaint by staff or any eligible entity pursuant to sections 386.390.1 or 393.260.1, RSMo, could be used to initiate a vexatious or frivolous rate case. Public Counsel advises the commission to require some intervening order from the commission to initiate a rate case to avoid that possibility. 
RESPONSE: The commission does not share Public Counsel’s con- cern. The referenced statutes already limit the ability of non-utility entities to bring a complaint seeking a change in the utility’s rates. No further limitation within this rule is necessary. No change will be made in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #5: Public Counsel suggests that if a small utility files a tariff to initiate a small rate case procedure, as it is allowed to do under subsection (3)(C), it should be required to affirmatively state that it intends to proceed under the staff assisted rate procedure rather than as a standard rate case. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: If such a tariff were to be filed by a utility, the commission would likely presume that the intent of the utility would be to follow a standard rate case procedure. But clarity in the rule is helpful, and the commission will modify the subsection as Public Counsel suggests. 
COMMENT #6: Public Counsel comments that a provision of para- graph (3)(A)1. allows a utility to withdraw its request for a rate increase at any time before one hundred fifty (150) days after it files its request to initiate the procedure. Public Counsel suggests the util- ity be allowed to withdraw its request at any time during the process, as would be allowed under the currently effective rule. RESPONSE: The commission does not agree with Public Counsel. After the procedure has reached the 150th day, staff will have pro- ceeded sufficiently with its investigation and audit to have an idea of whether a rate increase, or possibly a rate decrease, is necessary to ensure the existence of just and reasonable rates. At that stage of the process it may no longer be appropriate to allow the utility to unilat- erally withdraw from the ratemaking process. No change will be made in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #7: Public Counsel is concerned that section (4), which indicates staff will assist a small utility in processing a small utility rate case to the extent that assistance is “consistent with staff’s func- tion and responsibilities to the commission,” overstates the permissi- ble involvement staff may have in the rate process. Specifically, Public Counsel contends staff may not represent the utility and may not undertake the utility’s statutorily established burden of proving that its proposed rates are just and reasonable. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees its staff may not represent the utility and further, that sec- tion 393.150.2, RSMo establishes that the utility bears the burden of proving that its proposed rates are just and reasonable. This rule is not intended to change either fact. But the commission wants to clear- ly authorize staff to assist small utilities through the process estab- lished by this rule to the extent possible. 
Assisted rate cases for small utilities are necessary to ensure that rates are periodically reviewed. Some small utilities can be intimidat- ed by the prospect of a rate case, and, if not assisted through the process, may forego a necessary rate case. Some small utilities have waited more than twenty (20) years to request a rate case. At best, that means their ratepayers may face a very large rate increase when rates are finally adjusted. At worst, the small utility may not have suf- ficient revenue to meet its obligations and can enter a downward spi- ral of deferred or ignored maintenance, leading to poor or unsafe ser- vice, from which it may not be able to recover. 
The commission will modify section (4) to make it clear that staff is neither authorized to represent the utility, nor to assume the utili- ty’s burden of proof. 
COMMENT #8: Public Counsel is concerned about two (2) aspects of subsection (5)(A). That subsection allows staff and the small util- 
ity to agree in writing to extend the procedural timeline established by this case by thirty (30) days without the approval of the commis- sion or any other party, which in practice means Public Counsel. Staff explained that the allowable thirty- (30-) day extension would not extend the ultimate two hundred seventy- (270-) day deadline for issuance of the commission’s final decision regarding the rate increase request that is required by section (13) of this rule. 
Public Counsel urges the commission to allow for a sixty- (60-) day extension of the procedural timeline as is allowed under the com- mission’s current rule, arguing that more time may be needed to process a small rate case. Public Counsel would also like to be included in the decision of whether the procedural timeline should be extended. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The small utili- ty should have a say in whether the procedural timeline should be extended, as it is the utility’s request for a rate adjustment that will be delayed by any extension. But under the proposed rule, the requested extension does not delay the rate adjustment, rather it places a burden on Public Counsel to present its case in a shortened period and burdens the commission by reducing its time to deliberate and issue a decision. This revised rule already reduces the procedural timeline for final resolution of the rate request from eleven (11) months to two hundred seventy (270) days. If the timeline is extend- ed, the entire timeline should be extended. 
Staff is appropriately involved with any decision to extend the timeline because it is primarily responsible for conducting the inves- tigation and audit of the small utility. With the modification extending the entire procedural timeline, Public Counsel’s involvement in the extension decision becomes less important. The commission will allow for a thirty- (30-) day extension of each aspect of the timeline, but will leave that decision with the utility and staff. The commission will modify the rule accordingly. 
COMMENT #9: Staff explained that section (6) of the revised rule will change the timing of any local public hearing the commission may have at a location near the service territory of the small utility. Under the current regulation, such a local public hearing, if held at all, would be scheduled later in the procedural schedule, after staff has completed its investigation and audit, and after a disposition agreement has been reached. The new rule would call for the local public hearing to be scheduled much earlier in the process; within sixty (60) days after the opening of the case. It would also require that such local public hearing be held unless all parties agree it is not necessary. 
Public Counsel is concerned that having a local public hearing so early in the process will not be helpful because little information about the investigation and audit will be available to be shared with the ratepayers at that time. It suggests that if a local public hearing is held, it would be more productive later in the process. Public Counsel and staff agree it would not be advisable to have both an early and late local public hearing in the same case. 
RESPONSE: Moving the local public hearing to an earlier time in the process will allow the commission, its staff, Public Counsel, and the utility to hear the concerns of the utility’s customers about rates and the service they receive early enough in the process to make a difference in staff’s investigation and audit, and to influence any resulting disposition agreement. The commission will not make any change in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #10: Section (7) of the proposed rule establishes the notice to be given to a small utility’s ratepayers; describing the filing of the request for the rate increase and indicating how ratepayers may participate in that process. Staff explained that the proposed rule ties that notice with the notice of the setting of the local public hearing early in the process. Even if no local public hearing is scheduled, the single notice would still be given early in the process. Public Counsel urges the commission to continue the practice under the current rule of issuing both an early notice at the start of the process, and a later 

Page 790 
April 16, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 8 

Orders of Rulemaking 

notice issued after completion of the audit and investigation and fil- ing of a disposition agreement. RESPONSE: The commission believes that a single notice as con- templated in the proposed rule is appropriate, particularly as applied to the revised timing of a local public hearing to occur earlier in the process. The issuance of notices at multiple times in the process could unnecessarily confuse ratepayers. Ratepayers who are given notice early in the process can follow the process to its completion if they choose to do so. The commission will not make any change in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #11: Public Counsel comments that subsection (7)C) notifies customers that they have thirty (30) days to submit comments about the proposed rate increase. Public Counsel contends there is no reason to put a time limit on such comments. 
RESPONSE: The commission is willing to accept comments from the public at any time, but the time limit stated in the notice is appro- priate so that such comments can be available to staff as it prepares its investigation and audit and to Public Counsel as it makes its preparations. The commission will not make any change in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #12: Public Counsel points to a problem with how sec- tion (7) of the proposed rule is structured. As proposed, subsections (7)(A)–(D) are intended to delineate the content of the notice to be given to ratepayers. Subsection (7)(E) directs staff to file a copy of that notice in the file. But the way the rule is structured, subsection (7)(E) incorrectly appears to be another item to be included in the notice given to ratepayers. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with the comment. Section (7) will be restructured to cre- ate a subsection (7)(A) that includes the items to be included in the notice as paragraphs. The existing subsection (7)(E) is retained as a separate subsection. 
COMMENT #13: Public Counsel is concerned that section (8), which describes the investigation and audit that shall be conducted by staff, and may be conducted by Public Counsel, could be inter- preted in a way that would require Public Counsel to either undertake a detailed investigation or be barred from any participation in the case. 
RESPONSE: The commission reassures Public Counsel that its intent in modifying this rule is not to limit Public Counsel’s ability to fully participate in these rate cases involving small utilities. The specific provisions of the proposed rule that concern Public Counsel will be addressed in subsequent comments. 
COMMENT #14: Public Counsel notes that subsection (8)(A) indi- cates staff’s audit and investigation will follow staff internal proce- dures to ensure reasonable consistency. Public Counsel does not object to that provision, but asks that such internal procedures be made available to the public. Staff indicated such procedures are just general guidelines on how staff will conduct its investigations, not specific one-size-fits–all requirements. Staff internal policies would be made available to any member of the public that wishes to see them. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The subsec- tion’s reference to staff’s internal procedures is unnecessary and could be interpreted as incorporating an unpublished document into the rule. The commission will remove the reference to separate inter- nal procedures from the subsection. 
COMMENT #15: Subsection (8)(C) currently requires that data requests submitted to the utility are to be shared with all parties. Public Counsel suggests data request responses from the utility should also be shared. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees and the subsection will be modified to add that require- 
ment 
COMMENT #16: Public Counsel questions a provision in subsection (8)(E) that allows for the use of estimated values of normal expense items and rate base items in determining the small utility’s cost of service. Public Counsel is concerned that such language in the rule would create confusion about whether the utility has met its statutory burden to prove that the rates it is requesting are just and reasonable and supported by competent and substantial evidence. 
RESPONSE: The commission agrees that this rule cannot change the statutory burden of proof placed on the utility. Nothing in the rule is intended to do so. After hearing the evidence, the commission will decide whether any estimated value is sufficiently reliable to be com- petent and substantial evidence. No change will be made in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #17: Public Counsel is concerned about subsection (8)(D), which requires an update of the utilities rate base be included in an “investigation,” and subsection (8)(F), which requires staff to provide all parties with a report describing the results of its investi- gation and audit no later than ninety (90) days after the rate case is opened. In addition to directing staff to file its report, subsection (8)(F) directs Public Counsel to provide such a report if it is “con- ducting its own investigation.” Public Counsel does not believe the commission has authority to require it to conduct any particular investigation, and is concerned that if it chooses not to conduct a full investigation it might be precluded from otherwise participating in the case. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion does not intend to force Public Counsel to conduct any particu- lar investigation and the intent of section (8) is to guide staff’s inves- tigation. To assuage Public Counsel’s fears, the commission will change each reference to “the” investigation in this section to “staff’s” investigation. In addition, the commission will add a new subsection (8)(G) to require Public Counsel to report the results of whatever investigation it chooses to conduct. 
COMMENT #18: Section (9) directs staff to submit a confidential settlement proposal no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the small utility rate case is opened. It also requires Public Counsel to submit its own confidential settlement proposal if it chooses to conduct its own investigation. Public Counsel objects to the provi- sions of the section that would require Public Counsel to submit a settlement proposal or that would specify the contents of any settle- ment proposal Public Counsel might choose to submit. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion intended this rule to give Public Counsel an opportunity to sub- mit a settlement proposal in any case if it wishes to do so. It also wants to give staff and the utility a fair opportunity to respond to whatever settlement proposal Public Counsel offers. However, the commission recognizes that Public Counsel may choose for itself the extent to which it chooses to participate in any case before the com- mission. For that reason, the commission will delete paragraph (9)(A)3. and modify paragraph (9)(A)4., which purport to require Public Counsel to include certain items in any settlement proposal it may choose to submit. In addition, the commission will modify sub- section (9)(A) to clarify that Public Counsel may submit a settlement proposal, but is under no obligation to do so. 
COMMENT #19: Public Counsel expressed concern about a provi- sion of subsection (9)(C) that would require any party responding to a settlement proposal to provide audit workpapers, rate design work- papers, or other documents in its possession that support its sugges- tions. Public Counsel fears that many small utilities will not have such workpapers and documents to be able to include them with their response. 
RESPONSE: The proposed subsection merely requires the respond- ing parties to provide any such documents they possess. It does not 
 
April 16, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 8 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 791 

require them to create or produce any documents they do not already have in their possession. No change to the subsection will be made in response to the comment. 
COMMENT #20: Public Counsel expressed concern about the appropriateness of the wording of paragraphs (11)(A)1. and 2. Staff suggested modifications to improve that wording. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the modified language proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #21: Public Counsel suggests subsection (11)(C) be modified to require additional notice be sent to ratepayers to inform them that a rate tariff has been filed. RESPONSE: The commission does not believe additional notice is needed at that point in the process. No change will be made in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #22: Paragraph (11)(E)1. allows the small utility to request to be excused from participation in an evidentiary hearing where at least the staff and the utility have entered into a disposition agreement to fully resolve the rate case. Public Counsel objects that allowing the utility to avoid participation in the hearing would leave the utility unable to meet its statutory burden of proof and would improperly shift that burden of proof to staff. 
RESPONSE: The commission does not share Public Counsel’s con- cerns. As the commission clarified in response to comment #2, “dis- position agreement” is defined to be the equivalent of a “stipulation and agreement” in practice before the commission. If staff and the small utility have entered into a disposition agreement to which another party has objected, then the disposition agreement becomes merely a joint position of the signatory parties, to which neither party is bound. But, if staff and the small utility choose to present the dis- position agreement as their joint position, then staff can choose to present that position on its own behalf and the small utility does not need to duplicate staff’s efforts at the hearing. Each aspect of the dis- position agreement would need to be supported by competent and substantial evidence, but that supporting evidence could be provided by staff. No changes will be made in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #23: Public Counsel is concerned that section (13) allows the commission only twenty (20) days to deliberate and decide a rate case after it has been finally submitted by the submission of final briefs. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion shares that concern, but believes it is important to have a goal of completing these cases in a timely fashion so that just and reason- able rates can be established. However, the commission recognizes that circumstances may arise that will require additional time to deliberate and decide a case. For that reason, section (15) will be modified to explicitly provide that the two hundred seventy- (270-) day deadline for a final decision established in section (13) may be waived for good cause shown.

The staff’s audit and investigation will ensure rea- sonable consistency in the recommended rate treatment of the utili- ty’s rate base, revenue, and expenses with that of other similarly sit- uated utilities. 
(B) Staff’s investigation may include a review of the records gen- erated since the utility’s previous rate case, the case in which the utility was granted its Certificate of Convenience and Necessity, or the utility’s transfer of assets case, whichever is most recent. 
(C) If an investigation of the utility’s request includes the submis- sion of data requests to the utility, copies of the data requests shall be provided to all parties to the case when they are submitted to the utility. The utility’s responses to such data requests shall also be shared. 
(D) Staff’s investigation shall include an update of the utility’s rate base.
