HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO 
RULES 
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system– 
Title Division Chapter Rule 
3 CSR 10- 4 .115 Department Code of Agency General area Specific area 
State Division regulated regulated Regulations 
and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115. 
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a. 
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation, for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115 NOT Rule 10-4.115. Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated.

Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 1—OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATION Division 50—Missouri Ethics Commission Chapter 5—Committee Registration and Reporting 
EMERGENCY RULE 1 CSR 50-5.010 Definitions 
PURPOSE: This rule sets out the definitions of terms used in Chapter 1 CSR 50-5 of Missouri Ethics Commission to clarify registration and reporting requirements for certain types of committees. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The commission requests an emergency rule to take effect August 8, 2018 in order to preserve the compelling governmental interest of regulating campaign finance laws related to the November 6, 2018 general election. The rule sets out the defini- tions of terms used in Chapter 1 CSR 50-5 of Missouri Ethics Commission to clarify registration and reporting requirements for certain types of committees. 
Mo. Const. Art. VIII, Section 23.3 provides for contribution limits to certain candidates and aggregate contributions to political parties for any one (1) election. Mo. Const. Art. VIII, Section 23.7(11) defines an election as “any primary, general or special election...” Section 130.041.2 (1), RSMo provides election cycles for candidates for purposes of determining aggregate contributions for a primary ending at 11:59 p.m. on the day of the primary election. Finally, Mo. Const. Art. VIII, Sections 23.7(6)(c) and 23.7(20) require that con- tinuing and political action committees be formed no later than sixty (60) days prior to the election for which the committee receives con- 
tributions or makes expenditures. The deadline for forming a contin- uing/political action committee is September 7, 2018. Because the rule will require federal political action committees to register and report with the State of Missouri if certain monetary thresholds are met, an effective date which begins with the election cycle for the November 6, 2018 general election will serve the compelling govern- mental interest of regulation of federal contributors and Missouri committees who wish to participate in the general election, and give federal political action committees appropriate time to meet the September 7, 2018 formation deadline. 
The commission filed an order of rulemaking with JCAR on April 30, 2018 with the same content as this emergency rule. The earliest date that rule will take effect is August 30, 2018, after the beginning of the general election cycle, and one (1) week before the committee formation deadline to participate in the November general election. 
This emergency rule follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circum- stances, follows procedures which comply with protections extended by the Missouri and United States Constitutions, and is limited to the circumstances creating the required emergency action by seeking an effective date to coincide with the beginning of an election cycle, and with sufficient time for federal political action committees which wish to participate in the November general election but will be required to register and report with the commission to timely form and register with the commission. 
This emergency rule was filed April 30, 2018, becomes effective August 8, 2018, and expires on February 4, 2019. 
(1) As used in this chapter, the following terms mean: (A) Committee domiciled outside of this state - a campaign finance committee registered according to the campaign finance disclosure laws of a state, other than the State of Missouri, or as a federal polit- ical action committee, as defined in this rule, which is registered and 
reporting with the Federal Election Commission; (B) Federal political action committee – a political committee under 
52 U.S.C. 30101(4) that is not an authorized committee of a federal candidate under 52 U.S.C. 30101(6) or a federal committee of a national, state, or local political party under 52 U.S.C. 30101(4)(C), (14), or (15); 
(C) Commission – The Missouri Ethics Commission; 
(D) Continuing committee/Political action committee – a commit- tee defined as a continuing committee under Mo. Const. Art. VIII, section 23.7(6)(c) and section 130.011(10), RSMo, and Mo. Const. Art. VIII, section 23.7(20), or a political action committee under Mo. Const. Art. VIII, section 23.7(20); 
(E) Domicile – the address of a committee listed on a statement of organization as defined in section 130.026.6, RSMo; and 
(F) Out-of-state committee - a campaign finance committee regis- tered according to the campaign finance disclosure laws of a state, other than the State of Missouri, or a federal political action commit- tee as defined in this rule, which is registered and reporting with the Federal Election Commission. 
AUTHORITY: sections 105.955.14(7) and 105.961.3, RSMo 2016. Original rule filed Feb. 7, 2018. Emergency rule filed April 30, 2018, effective Aug. 8, 2018, expires Feb. 4, 2019.

Emergency Rules 

PURPOSE: This rule clarifies and makes consistent the rules requir- ing committees domiciled outside the state of Missouri and out-of- state committees, including certain federal committees, to register and file campaign finance disclosure reports with the Missouri Ethics Commission. The rule also clarifies federal committees which qualify as federal political action committees for purposes of contributions to Missouri committees under the Missouri Constitution. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The commission requests an emergency rule to take effect August 8, 2018 in order to preserve the compelling governmental interest of regulating campaign finance laws related to the November 6, 2018 general election. 
Mo. Const. Art. VIII, Section 23.3 provides for contribution limits to certain candidates and aggregate contributions to political parties for any one (1) election. Mo. Const. Art. VIII, Section 23.7(11) defines an election as “any primary, general or special election...” Section 130.041.2 (1), RSMo provides election cycles for candidates for purposes of determining aggregate contributions for a primary ending at 11:59 p.m. on the day of the primary election. Finally, Mo. Const. Art. VIII, Sections 23.7(6)(c) and 23.7(20) require that con- tinuing and political action committees be formed no later than sixty (60) days prior to the election for which the committee receives con- tributions or makes expenditures. The deadline for forming a con- tinuing/political action committee is September 7, 2018. Because the rule will require federal political action committees to register and report with the State of Missouri if certain monetary thresholds are met, an effective date which begins with the election cycle for the November 6, 2018 general election will serve the compelling govern- mental interest of regulation of federal contributors and Missouri committees who wish to participate in the general election, and give federal political action committees appropriate time to meet the September 7, 2018 formation deadline. 
The commission filed an order of rulemaking with JCAR on April 30, 2018 with the same content as this emergency rule.

This emergency rule was filed April 30, 2018, becomes effective August 8, 2018, and expires on February 4, 2019.

(4) Federal political action committees domiciled within the state of Missouri shall be required to follow the requirements of section (2) if they meet the definition of a continuing committee/political action committee under Mo.

MISSOURI Proposed Rules June 1, 2018 REGISTER Vol. 43, No. 11 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

[(2) Only a person who complies with the requirements of these rules shall be entitled to receive and retain a permit. Permits shall not be transferable with respect to persons, locations, or both. 
(3) The regulatory agency shall suspend the permit, when- ever it has reason to believe that a public health hazard exists; or whenever the permit holder has violated any of the requirements of these rules or whenever the permit holder has interfered with the regulatory agency in the performance of its duties. Provided that the regulatory agency, in all cases except where the milk or milk product involved creates, or appears to create, an imminent hazard to the public health, or in any case of a willful refusal to permit authorized inspec- tion, shall serve upon the holder a written notice of intent to suspend permit, which notice shall specify with particularity the violation(s) in question and afford the holder reasonable opportunity to correct the violation(s) as may be agreed to by the parties, or in the absence of agreement, fixed by the regulatory agency before making any order of suspension effective. Any permit suspension shall remain in effect until the violation has been corrected to the satisfaction of the regulatory agency. Prior to reinstatement when permit sus- pension has been due to a somatic cell violation, in addition to complying with the requirements contained elsewhere in these rules, the analysis of an individual producer sample meeting the somatic cell standards outlined in 2 CSR 80- 2.070 (Section 7 of the PMO) shall be made. The sample shall be analyzed in an official or officially designated labo- ratory. 
(4) Upon written notification to the regulatory agency by any person whose permit has been suspended, or upon applica- tion within forty-eight (48) hours of any person who has been served with a notice of intention to suspend, and in the latter case before suspension, the regulatory agency, within seventy-two (72) hours, shall proceed to a hearing to ascer- tain facts of the violation or interference and upon evidence presented at the hearing shall affirm, modify, or rescind the suspension or intention to suspend. 
(5) Upon repeated violation(s), the regulatory agency may revoke the permit following reasonable notice to the permit holder and an opportunity for a hearing. This rule is not intended to preclude the institution of court action as provid- ed in 2 CSR 80-2.050 (Section 5 of the PMO) and 2 CSR 80- 2.060 (Section 6 of the PMO).

Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 80—State Milk Board Chapter 2—Grade “A” Pasteurized Milk Regulations 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
2 CSR 80-2.190 State Milk Board Grade “A” Milk Policies. The State Milk Board is amending sections (2), (3), (11), (13), (14), and (17). 
PURPOSE: The purpose of this amendment is to update wording. 
(2) Authentic Freeze Point Procedure. (A) In order to obtain uniformity in establishing an authentic 
freezing point, the following procedure should be implemented: 1. The producer must request the assistance for the establish- ment of an authentic freeze point to the State Milk Board in writing; 2. The State Milk Board will notify the servicing sanitarian and fieldman of the request. In the absence of a fieldman, two (2) sani- tarians from the State Milk Board or its agent should implement the 
procedure; 3. On the date of the test, the producer must make sure to— 
A. Thoroughly wash, rinse, and sanitize all milk contact sur- faces after the morning milking and milk pickup; 
B. Maintain all milk contact surfaces in a manner to allow complete drainage, including the pump and all low points in the milk- ing equipment to eliminate any entrapped water; 
C. Not allow milk contact surfaces to be sanitized or allow any water to come in contact with any milk contact surfaces after the State Milk Board or its agents have arrived for testing; 
D. Not dip inflations between [cows] dairy animals or per- form any procedure that could allow any water to enter the milk sup- ply; and 
E. Prepare for and perform evening milking as normal; 4. At the conclusion of the milking procedure, the producer should not flush the pipeline with water while the pipeline is attached to the bulk tank. This is a prohibited procedure at any time. As soon as the milk has entered the bulk tank and has remained quiescent for at least five (5) minutes, the State Milk Board or its agent should measure the milk, take a sample of the milk, and place it on ice 
immediately; 5. The producer must follow the procedures outlined in para- 
graph (2)(A)3. above in order to allow all cleaned and sanitized sur- faces to drain overnight; 
6. Thirty (30) minutes prior to normal milking time the next morning, the State Milk Board or its agents should measure the milk in the bulk milk tank after a quiescent period of at least five (5) min- utes. Next, the State Milk Board or its agents should agitate the milk thoroughly and collect a second sample; 

Page 1138 
Proposed Rules 
June 1, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 11 
7. The producer should follow the same procedure utilized in the previous milking to ensure that no water is allowed to come in contact with, or obtain entrance into, the milk supply; 
8. At the end of the second milking, the State Milk Board or its agent must thoroughly agitate the milk and collect a sample; 
9. The State Milk Board or its agent should transport the three (3) milk samples on ice directly to an approved milk testing labora- tory. The laboratory should be notified in advance and arrangements should be made to conduct the freeze point test. The sample collect- ed at the end of the first milking and the sample collected prior to the beginning of the second milking should provide a freezing point of a variance not greater than −0.002 degrees centigrade. There may be a slight variance in the two (2) samples as carbon dioxide in milk passes off as a gas between the night and morning milkings. If the variance is greater than −0.002 degrees centigrade, the milk itself was altered between milkings by something other than the release of carbon dioxide. To prevent such an occurrence, the producer should lock the milk house door between these tested milkings; and 
10. If the authentic freeze point procedure outlined in this reg- ulation is used, the producer will document the procedure and pro- vide documentation to the State Milk Board. The samples collected immediately after the two (2) milkings will be the official non-water freezing record for the producer. For enforcement purposes, the pro- ducer will be allowed a freezing point of −0.005 degrees centigrade less than the results of the lowest number of the two (2) officially tested samples that were collected after the evening and morning milkings. Once established, the authentic freezing point will remain in effect for a producer until the producer’s feeding program or herd is substantially changed. 
(3) [Antibiotic] Drug Residue Test. (A) Whenever a[n antibiotic] drug residue test is found to be pos- 
itive, the State Milk Board shall immediately suspend the producer’s permit. 
(11) Farm Bulk Milk Collections. (A) Farm bulk milk collections shall be made at least once every 
forty-eight (48) hours or every other day. Extended pickups may be granted by individual request to the executive secretary of the State Milk Board [with information showing use of milk outside the Grade “A” market. This regulation is barring an act of God or other emergencies beyond the control of the hauler or pro- ducer.] provided the safety and quality of milk is maintained and the delayed collection does not extend beyond the limit allowed by law. In the event of a natural disaster or emergency limiting milk pickups beyond the control of the hauler or producer this regu- lation may be waived across specified geographic regions as need- ed. 
(13) Distributors. (A) This regulation affects inspection and permitting of distribu- 
tors. 
1. A distributor number is “D” plus the required number of dig- its in each contractee’s permit number series. 
2. “Distributor” is defined as an individual or company that handles finished dairy products beyond the responsibility of the dairy plant and prior to delivery to retailers and/or consumers and any milk processing plant-owned branch operation in which a permanent or mobile-milk cooler is operated. 
3. Distribution permits shall be issued by the contractee respon- sible for the area in which the distributor is located. 
4. Permanent branch or independent distributing points, such as milk coolers, [shall] will be inspected at least once each [six (6)] twelve (12) months according to the following current Grade “A” Pasteurized Milk Ordinance items: 
A. Item 2p. Walls and Ceilings – Construction; B. Item 6p. Toilet-Sewage Disposal Facilities; C. Item 7p. Water Supply;

quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) as chemical sanitizers for milk contact surfaces provided the QAC meets the preceding require- ments of policy 14, part 1-a, b, c, d, and 21 CFR 178.1010 with the exception: QACs are not acceptable sanitizers for sampling equip- ment. Since chlorhexidine is not listed in 21 CFR 178.1010, it is unacceptable as a sanitizer for dairy equipment, udders, and teats of dairy [cows] animals. 
(16) Transfer from One Milk Marketing Agency to Another. (A) When a producer requests a transfer from one milk marketing agency to another, there is a mandatory three- (3-)[-] day waiting peri- od after receipt of the transfer requested by the contracted inspection agency excluding weekends and holidays. The three- (3-)[-] day period 
may be waived when agreeable to both marketing agencies. 
(17) Barn Plans. (B) Each approved barn plan must identify all equipment and show 
dimensions and location including pipe lengths and physical break locations. All location of equipment and dimensions must be clearly shown in accordance with the informational guide.

PURPOSE: [The purpose of t]This rule [is to] protects the rights and ensures the appropriate treatment of youth moved from one Division of Youth Services (DYS) [facility] program to another. The procedure is to be used if a youth has been inappropriately classified into a [facility] program or if the [facility] program is not meeting the youth’s needs. [Residential care services are those services which provide twenty-four (24)-hour living accommodations and are operated by division employees. These facilities include group homes, park camps and institutions.] 
(1) An administrative transfer may be effected when a change in placement, either interagency or intragency, may better serve the needs of the youth. An administrative transfer is a transfer from one (1) foster home to another, from one (1) community-based facility to another, or from one (1) [institution] medium or secure care facil- ity to another.

2. A placement in a different area would provide access to a program(s) and that would be of special benefit to the youth; and

external forces make it difficult for [him/her] them to obtain maxi- mum value from the placement. 
(B) The youth, [his/her] their parent(s) or guardian(s) or site supervisor or service coordinator may request an administrative transfer in writing to the regional administrator [and his/her] or their designee. The regional administrator or [his/her] their designee shall review the request and, if appropriate, [shall] autho- rize the transfer. In determining whether a transfer is appropriate, the following information as relevant in reaching a conclusion shall be considered: 
1. Reasons offered both in support of and in opposition to the transfer; 
2. Evaluation of the progress of the youth in the current place- ment; and 
3. Availability of space in other programs and approval of the receiving facility manager. If this transfer is across regional lines, then the appropriate regional administrator or [his/her] their designee shall be involved. 
(C) The regional administrator or [his/her] their designee shall notify, in writing, the youth, [his/her] their parent(s) or guardian(s), and site supervisor or service coordinator of the decision as to whether the transfer is approved or disapproved and the reason there- fore. The decision shall be made within [two (2)] five (5) working days of the request and a copy of the transfer shall be included in the youth’s case record. 
(2) A vertical transfer is a transfer from a community-based program to any DYS residential program. 
(A) A vertical transfer may be effected when—1) the youth poses a danger to the safety of other persons, [staff] employees, the site, or the community; or 2) the youth will benefit more from the pro- gram(s) offered at the recommended site than from the program(s) offered in the current placement. 
(B) The following procedures must be followed [in order to effect] for a vertical transfer: 
1. The youth, parent(s) or guardian(s), site supervisor, or ser- vice coordinator may request a transfer; 
2. The request shall be in writing to the regional administrator or [his/her] their designee and shall state the reasons the transfer is being requested; 
3. Upon receipt of the request, the regional administrator or [his/her] their designee shall appoint a hearing officer and one (1) or more parties who are neutral and objective to hold a hearing; 
4. The hearing officer shall set a date for a hearing on the ques- tion of transfer. This hearing shall be held within [seven (7)] fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the request is received; 
5. The youth, parent(s) or guardian(s) of the youth, and the site supervisor or service coordinator shall be given adequate and timely notice of the time and place of the hearing and of the reasons there- fore, stated with specificity, that the transfer has been requested; and 
6. The youth and the parent(s) or guardian(s) of the youth shall also be notified that the youth has the right to present evidence, to confront and cross-examine witnesses, and to remain silent at the hearing. Further, the youth shall have the right to request a staff member or a parent(s) or guardian(s) or attorney to represent him/her at this hearing. 
(C) Only information introduced as evidence at the hearing shall be considered by the hearing officer(s). The following are considered relevant to the determination: the treatment needs of the youth; and whether other programs, either community-based or [institutional] residential, would provide a program(s) better suited to the needs of the youth. 
(D) Within [two (2)] five (5) working days of the hearing, the hearing officer(s) shall notify, in writing, the youth, the parent(s) or guardian(s) of the youth, and the person who has physical custody of the youth of its decision and the reasons therefore. 
(E) A vertical transfer shall not be authorized as punishment.

(3) An interagency transfer is a transfer from a program or facility operated by or under the control of the division to a program or facil- ity operated by or under the control of another agency. 
(B) The director or [his/her] their designee may authorize an interagency transfer if, after a careful examination of the youth’s needs, [s/he] they determine[s] that the transfer should be effected. After a decision for transfer is made, the youth, [his/her] their par- ent(s) or guardian(s), and the service coordinator will be notified of the decision and the reasons for the transfer. One (1) copy of the notice will be retained in the youth’s case record. 
(4) Appeal of a Transfer Decision. When the decision is made to transfer the youth, the youth and the parent(s) or guardian(s) of the youth shall be notified of the right to petition the director for a hear- ing to review the decision in accordance with 219.051, RSMo [1994].

Title 16—RETIREMENT SYSTEMS Division 20—Missouri Local Government Employees’ Retirement System (LAGERS) Chapter 2—Administrative Rules 
PROPOSED RULE 
16 CSR 20-2.115 Administration of Prior Non-LAGERS Retirement Plans 
PURPOSE: This rule further defines the procedures to be used when a political subdivision and the Missouri Local Government Employees’ Retirement System (LAGERS) enter into an agreement for LAGERS to assume all duties and responsibilities for operating the political subdivision’s prior retirement plan pursuant to section 70.621, RSMo. 
(1) As used in this rule, the terms below shall be defined as follows: (A) “LAGERS Plan” means a political subdivision’s active retire- 
ment benefit program with LAGERS; and (B) “Legacy Plan” means a plan similar in purpose to LAGERS 
for which the political subdivision and LAGERS have entered into an agreement whereby LAGERS assumes all duties and responsibilities of operating the plan pursuant to 70.621, RSMo. 
(2) When calculating an employer’s contribution rate pursuant to 70.730, RSMo when the employer and LAGERS have entered into an agreement for LAGERS to administer the member’s Legacy Plan, the following procedures shall be applied: 
(A) For purposes of computing the employer contribution rates under section 70.730, RSMo, separate employer contribution rates will be computed for the LAGERS Plan and the Legacy Plan. The contribution rate for the Legacy Plan will be expressed as a dollar amount; 
(B) For the purposes of calculating the limitation on increases to an employer’s contribution provided by subsection 6 of 70.730, RSMo, the employer contribution rate will be calculated as a com- bined employer contribution rate expressed as a percentage of total (i.e., LAGERS Plan plus Legacy Plan) payroll, including when the Legacy Plan has active members and when the Legacy Plan does not have active members. Both the LAGERS Plan contribution rate and the combined employer contribution rate shall be subject to the lim- itation on increases to an employer’s contribution rate; 
(C) For the first year in which the Legacy Plan is operated by LAGERS, the limitation on increases in an employer’s contribution provided by subsection 6 of 70.730, RSMo shall not apply to any contribution increase; and 
(D) The Board of Trustees may, in its sole discretion, elect to establish a fixed payment schedule for a Legacy Plan. At such time as a fixed payment schedule is established, a combined employer contribution rate, as described above in subsection (2)(B), will no longer be calculated and the employer contribution rate will again be expressed as a percentage of total LAGERS Plan payroll. For the first year in which a fixed payment schedule is established and the com- bined employer contribution rate is no longer calculated, the limita- tion on increases in an employer’s contribution provided by subsec- 
tion 6 of 70.730, RSMo shall not apply to any contribution increase. 
(3) An active, deferred, or retired member of a Legacy Plan shall not be eligible to hold the position of a member trustee on the LAGERS Board of Trustees, to serve as a member delegate to the LAGERS annual meeting, or to participate in the election of the member del- egate to attend the LAGERS annual meeting. However, an active, deferred, or retired member of a Legacy Plan may be eligible to hold the position of an employer trustee on the LAGERS Board of Trustees or the trustee appointed by the governor, provided that he or she meets the other criteria for eligibility for those positions. 
AUTHORITY: sections 70.605.21 and 70.621.4, RSMo 2016. Original rule filed May 1, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rule will not cost state agencies more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. This proposed rule may result in a savings or a cost in an undetermined amount to any political subdivision that voluntarily enters into an agreement with LAGERS for the administration of a legacy pension plan pursuant to section 70.621, RSMo. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed rule will not cost private entities more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate.
