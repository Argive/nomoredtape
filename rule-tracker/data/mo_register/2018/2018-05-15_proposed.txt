HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO 
RULES 
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system– 
Title Division Chapter Rule 
3 CSR 10- 4 .115 Department Code of Agency General area Specific area 
State Division regulated regulated Regulations 
and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115. 
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a. 
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation, for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115 NOT Rule 10-4.115. Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated.

Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2150—State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts Chapter 5—General Rules 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2150-5.100 Collaborative Practice. The board is amending 
subsection (2)(B). 
PURPOSE: The proposed amendment changes the mileage limita- tion. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts and the Missouri State Board of Nursing (boards) find that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare requires emergency action by increasing the mileage restrictions to sev- enty-five (75) miles. In current regulation, an advanced practice reg- istered nurse cannot be more than thirty (30) miles or fifty (50) miles in a health professional shortage area from the collaborating physi- cian. This rule will expand that limit to seventy-five (75) miles. The mileage restriction directly impacts citizens’ access to healthcare providers which can lead to rescheduled or missed appointments, delayed care, and missed or delayed medication use. These conse- quences lead to poorer management of chronic illness and thus poorer health outcomes. 
Additionally, this emergency amendment is necessary to preserve a compelling governmental interest that requires an early effective date by addressing the public’s access to healthcare to improve health out- comes, reduced health disparities, and lower healthcare expendi- tures. When Missourians have access to primary healthcare services and resources, their health problems are detected and treated earli- er. The boards believe that procedures best calculated to assure fair- ness to all interested persons and parties in that the mileage restric- tions have been discussed at several legislative hearings, at the Board of Nursing’s March 2, 2018 board meeting, and in the Board of Healing Arts’ March 9, 2018 mail ballot which provided adequate public notice for the proposed amendment. This emergency amend- ment limits its scope to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended by the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The board believes this emergency amendment to be fair to all interested persons and parties under the circum- stances. This emergency amendment was filed April 16, 2018, becomes effective April 26, 2018, and expires February 5, 2019. 
(2) Geographic Areas. (B) The following shall apply in the use of a collaborative practice 
arrangement by an APRN who provides health care services that include the diagnosis and initiation of treatment for acutely or chron- ically ill or injured persons: 
1. If the APRN is providing services pursuant to section 335.175, RSMo, no mileage limitation shall apply; 
[2. If the APRN is not providing services pursuant to section 335.175, RSMo, and is practicing in a federally-des- ignated health professional shortage area (HPSA), the prac- tice locations where the collaborating physician, or other physician designated in the collaborative practice arrange- ment, is no further than fifty (50) miles by road, using the most direct route available, from the collaborating APRN; or] 
[3.]2. If the APRN is not providing services pursuant to section 335.175, RSMo, [and is practicing in a non-HPSA,] the collabo- rating physician and collaborating APRN shall practice within [thirty (30)] seventy-five (75) miles by road of one another. 
AUTHORITY: sections 334.104.3, 334.125, 335.036, and 335.175, [RSMo Supp. 2013, and section 334.125,] RSMo [Supp. 2014] 2016. This rule originally filed as 4 CSR 150-5.100. Original rule filed Jan. 29, 1996, effective Sept. 30, 1996. For intervening his- tory, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Emergency amendment filed April 16, 2018, effective April 26, 2018, expires Feb. 5, 2019. A proposed amendment covering this same material is pub- lished in this issue of the Missouri Register.

EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2200-4.200 Collaborative Practice. The board is amending

seventy-five (75) miles. In current regulation, an advanced practice registered nurse cannot be more than thirty (30) miles or fifty (50) miles in a health professional shortage area from the collaborating physician. This rule will expand that limit to seventy-five (75) miles.

Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
10 CSR 10-2.340 Control of Emissions From Lithographic and Letterpress Printing [Installations] Operations. The commission proposes to amend the rule title of this rule, amend the purpose, and amend subsections (1)(A)–(1)(C), (2)(A)–(2)(H), (3)(B) and (3)(D), (4)(A) and (5)(A). If the commission adopts this rule action, the department intends to submit this rule amendment to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to replace the current rule that is in the Missouri State Implementation Plan. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking is available for viewing at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air Pollution Control Program at the address listed in the Notice of Public Hearing at the end of this rule. More information concerning this rulemaking can be found at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Proposed Rules website www.dnr.mo.gov/proposed-rules. 
PURPOSE: The purpose of this proposed rulemaking is to remove the unnecessary use of restrictive words, update incorporation by refer- ence information, add definitions specific to this rule, and make administrative updates. It also replaces the word installations with operations in the title for consistency with its St. Louis area counter- 
part rule. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rule- making, per 536.016, RSMo, is 536.175 RSMo; and Executive Order 17-03 Red Tape Reduction Review and related comments. 
PURPOSE: This regulation restricts volatile organic compound emis- sions from lithographic printing [facilities] operations. 
(1) Applicability. (A) This regulation [shall apply] applies throughout Clay, 
Jackson, and Platte Counties. (B) This regulation shall apply to installations that have calculated 
actual volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions for a known num- ber of crewed hours, increased by the amount by weight of VOCs whose emission into the atmosphere is prevented by the use of air pollution control devices and extrapolated to eight thousand seven hundred sixty (8,760) hours per year equal to or greater than one hundred (100) tons per year from offset lithographic printing presses after December 9, 1991. The following factors shall be taken into consideration unless an alternative method is approved by the direc- tor: 
1. [The installation shall a]Assume fifty percent (50%) of the solvent used for cleanup is retained in the rag(s) when the used sol- vent-laden rag(s) are cleaned or disposed of. The installation must demonstrate to the director that the solvents are not evaporated into the air when the waste rags are properly cleaned and disposed of; 
2. [The installation shall a]Assume forty percent (40%) of the heatset ink oils stay in the paper web; 
3. [The installation shall a]Assume no VOCs are emitted from the inks used in sheet-fed presses and nonheatset web presses; and 
4. [The installation may a]Assume that fifty percent (50%) of the alcohol from the fountain solution is emitted from the dryer. 
(C) This regulation [shall] does not apply to— 1. Printing on fabric, metal, or plastic; 2. Sheet-fed lithographic presses with cylinder widths of twen- 
ty-six inches (26") or less; or 3. Web lithographic presses with cylinder widths of eighteen 
inches (18") or less. 
(2) Definitions. (A) Alcohol—Refers to isopropanol [or], isopropyl alcohol, nor- 
mal propyl alcohol, or ethanol; (B) Coating—[In the graphic arts industry, a layer of material 
that dries or cures by evaporation and is applied to a sub- strate over ink in a relatively unbroken film;] A protective, dec- orative, or functional material applied in a thin layer to a sur- face. Such materials include, but are not limited to, paints, top- coats, varnishes, sealers, stains, washcoats, basecoats, inks, and temporary protective coatings; 
(C) Fountain solution—The solution which is applied to the image plate to maintain the hydrophilic properties of the nonimage areas. It is primarily water containing an etchant, gum arabic, and a dampen- ing aid (commonly containing alcohol and alcohol substitutes); 
(D) Heatset—A class of web-offset [lithography which requires a heated dryer to evaporate the ink oils and solvents from the printing inks;] lithographic and letterpress printing in which the setting of the printing inks requires a heated dryer to evapo- rate the ink oils. The setting or curing of inks using only radia- tion (e.g., infrared, ultraviolet light, or electron beam) is not heatset and is classified as nonheatset; 
(E) Lithographic printing—[A printing process where a plano- graphic plate is used with the image area oleophilic and the nonimage area hydrophilic;] A planographic printing process where the image and nonimage areas are chemically differentiat- ed; the image area is oil receptive and the nonimage area is water receptive. This method differs from other printing methods, where the image is typically printed from a raised or recessed surface. Offset lithographic printing is the only common type of 

Page 1018 
Proposed Rules 
May 15, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 10 
lithographic printing used for commercial printing; 
(F) [Offset—The process that transfers an image from a plate to a rubber blanket cylinder before transfer to the sub- strate surface to be printed;] Offset lithographic printing—A printing process that transfers the ink film from the lithographic plate to an intermediary surface (rubber-covered blanket cylin- der), which, in turn, transfers the ink film to the substrate; 
(G) Sheet-fed—[Printing presses that are fed from a stack of paper sheets instead of a web. Sheet-fed presses generally use coldset inks] A printing press where individual sheets of substrate are fed into the press sequentially; and 
(H) Web—[The substrate printed in a continuous roll-fed printing process] A printing process where a continuous roll of substrate is fed into the press. 
(3) General Provisions. (B) No owner or operator shall use or permit the use of any offset 
lithographic printing press that uses cleanup solvents containing VOCs unless— 
1. The cleanup solvents are kept in tightly covered tanks or con- tainers during transport and storage; 
2. The cleaning cloths used with the cleanup solvents are placed in tightly closed containers when not in use and while awaiting off- site transportation. The cleaning cloths should be properly cleaned and disposed of[. The cloths, when properly cleaned or dis- posed of, are processed in a way that as much of the sol- vent, as practicable, is recovered for further use or destroyed.

(1)(C)1. through 5. of this rule are not subject to this rule. 1. Any unit subject to and in compliance with the Phase II Acid 
Rain program (40 CFR 96 subpart AAA). 2. A boiler or process heater that is used specifically for 
research and development. This does not include units that only pro- vide heat or steam commercially to a process at a research and devel- opment installation. 
3. Temporary boilers as defined in section (2) of this rule. 
4. Any unit under subsection (1)(A) of this rule which demon- strates, using the emission estimation methods outlined in section (5) of this rule, that the unit’s mass SO2 emissions are twenty-five (25) tons or less during the calendar year. To the extent such demonstra- tion relies on pollution control equipment or operational controls, such controls must be enforceable. 
5. Boilers that exclusively burn natural gas, liquefied petroleum (LP) gas, and/or fuel oil number two (2) with less than five-tenths percent (0.5%) sulfur, at the option of the installation. 
6. Loss of exemption. If the exemption limit in paragraph (1)(C)4. of this rule is [subsequently] exceeded, the exemption [shall] no longer [apply] applies and the owner or operator must notify the staff director or designee within thirty (30) days of such event. If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the staff director or designee that the exemption limit was exceeded due to emergency operations or uncontrolled circumstances, the exemption in para- graph (1)(C)4. of this rule [shall be] is reinstated. Emergency events include the use of boilers to produce power for critical networks or equipment when electric power from the local utility or the normal power source, if the installation runs on its own power production, is interrupted, or the use of boilers to pump water in the case of fire or flood, etc. The use of boilers to reduce electricity drawn from a power utility during utility designated peak time periods, to supply power to an electric grid, or to supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity is not considered an emergency event.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
10 CSR 10-6.040 Reference Methods. The commission proposes to amend the purpose and sections (1) through (8); and add new sec- tions (9) through (36). If the commission adopts this rule action, it will be the department’s intention to submit this rule amendment to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency to replace the current rule that is in the Missouri State Implementation Plan. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking is available for viewing at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air 
Pollution Control Program at the address listed in the Notice of Public Hearing at the end of this rule. More information concerning this rulemaking can be found at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Proposed Rules website www.dnr.mo.gov/proposed- rules. 
PURPOSE: The purpose of this rulemaking is to amend the rule pur- pose and update the incorporation by reference date to include the latest Federal Register Notices that promulgated new equivalency methods for monitoring ambient air concentrations of carbon monox- ide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), lead (Pb), particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10), and particulate matter between 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter (PM10-2.5); and new reference methods for CO, PM2.5, PM10, PM10-2.5, O3, and sulfur dioxide (SO2).

Title 10—DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Division 10—Air Conservation Commission Chapter 6—Air Quality Standards, Definitions, Sampling and Reference Methods and Air Pollution Control Regulations for the Entire State of Missouri 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
10 CSR 10-6.110 Reporting Emission Data, Emission Fees, and Process Information. The commission proposes to amend section (2), and amend subsections (3)(A)–(3)(C), and subsection (4)(C). If the commission adopts this rule action, the department intends to submit this rule amendment to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to replace the current rule that is in the Missouri State Implementation Plan. The evidence supporting the need for this pro- posed rulemaking is available for viewing at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air Pollution Control Program at the address listed in the Notice of Public Hearing at the end of this rule. More information concerning this rulemaking can be found at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Proposed Rules web- site www.dnr.mo.gov/proposed-rules. 
PURPOSE: This rule provides procedures for reporting emission related information and establishing emission fees for the purpose of state air resource planning. The purpose of this rulemaking is to update the applicable year(s) for the emission fee. There will be no change to the fees at this time. This rulemaking will also comply with Executive Order 17-03 criteria and related comments by removing any unnecessary use of restrictive words, and add definitions specific to this rule and make administrative updates. In addition, the requirement to provide a 45-day comment period for revisions to the department-supplied permit application form is being removed as the program has better mechanisms to communicate with the regulated community than a department-supplied form. The evidence support- ing the need for this proposed rulemaking, per 536.016, RSMo, is 643.079 RSMo, and Executive Order 17-03 Red Tape Reduction Review and related comments.

(3) General Provisions. (A) Emission Fees. 
1. Any installation subject to this rule, except sources that pro- duce charcoal from wood, shall pay an annual emission fee per ton of applicable pollutant emissions identified in Table 2 of this rule based on previous calendar year emissions and in accordance with paragraphs (3)(A)2. through (3)(A)7. of this rule. The emission fee shall be forty dollars and no cents ($40.00) per ton until January 1, 2016, after which the fee shall be forty-eight dollars and no cents ($48.00) per ton effective January 1, 2019. 
2. For Full Emissions Reports, the fee is based on the informa- tion provided in the installation’s emissions report. For sources which qualify for and use the Reduced Reporting Form, the fee shall be based on the last Full Emissions Report. 
3. The fee shall apply to the first four thousand (4,000) tons of each air pollutant subject to fees as identified in Table 2 of this rule. No installation shall be required to pay fees on total emissions in excess of twelve thousand (12,000) tons for any reporting year. An installation subject to this rule which emitted less than one (1) ton of all pollutants subject to fees shall pay a fee for one (1) ton. 
4. An installation which pays emission fees to a holder of a cer- tificate of authority issued pursuant to section 643.140, RSMo, may deduct those fees from the emission fee due under this section. 
5. The fee imposed in paragraph (3)(A)1. of this rule shall not apply to NH3, CO, PM2.5, or HAPs reported as PM10 or VOC, as summarized in Table 2 of this rule. 
6. Emission fees for the reporting year are due June 1 after each reporting year. The fees shall be payable to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. 
7. To determine emission fees, an installation shall be consid- ered one (1) source as defined in section 643.078.2, RSMo, except that an installation with multiple operating permits shall pay emission fees separately for air pollutants emitted under each individual per- mit.

Copies can be obtained from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield VA 22161. This rule does not incorporate any subsequent amend- ments or additions; 
E. Other EPA documents as specified in subparagraph (3)(B)2.C. of this rule; 
F. Sound engineering or technical calculations; or 
G. Facilities shall obtain department approval of emission estimation methods other than those listed in subparagraphs (3)(B)1.A.–F. of this rule before using any such method to estimate emissions in the submission of an emissions report. 
2. The director reserves the authority to review and approve all emission estimation methods used to calculate emissions for the pur- pose of filing an emissions report for accuracy, reliability, and appro- priateness. Inappropriate usage of an emission factor or method shall include, but is not limited to: varying from the method used in permit without prior approval, using emission factors not representative of a process, using equipment in a manner other than that for which it was designed for in calculating emissions, or using a less accurate emission estimation method for a process when a facility has more accurate emission data available. Additional requirements for the use of a specific emission estimation method include: 
A. Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS). (I) CEMS must be shown to have met applicable perfor- mance specifications during the period for which data is being pre- 
sented. (II) CEMS data must be presented in the units which the 
system was designed to measure. Additional data sets used to extrap- olate CEMS data must have equal or better reliability for such extrapolation to be acceptable. 
(III) When using CEMS data to estimate emissions, the data must include all parameters (i.e., emission rate, gas flow rate, etc.) necessary to accurately determine the emissions. CEMS data which does not include all the necessary parameters must be reviewed and approved by the director or local air pollution control authority before it may be used to estimate emissions; 
B. Stack tests. (I) Stack tests must be conducted on the specific equipment 
for which the stack test results are used to estimate emissions. (II) Stack tests must be conducted according to the meth- ods cited in 10 CSR 10-6.030, unless an alternative method has been approved in advance by the director or local air pollution control 
authority. (III) Stack tests will not be accepted unless the choice of 
test sites and a detailed test plan have been approved in advance by the director or local air pollution control authority. 
(IV) Stack tests will not be accepted unless the director or local air pollution control authority has been notified of test dates at least thirty (30) days in advance and thus provided the opportunity to observe the testing. This thirty (30)-day notification may be reduced or waived on a case-by-case basis by the director or local air pollu- tion control authority. 
(V) Stack test results which do not meet all the criteria of parts (3)(B)2.B.(I)–(IV) of this rule may be acceptable for estimating emissions but must be submitted for review and approval by the director or local air pollution control authority on a case-by-case basis; and

to prepare documentation if this audit is done on-site. 2. The department may make emission fee adjustments when 
any of the following applies— A. Clerical or arithmetic errors have been made; B. Submitted documentation is not supported by inspections 
or audits; C. Emissions estimates are modified as a result of emission 
verification or audits; D. Credit has been incorrectly applied for an emissions fee 
paid to a local air pollution control agency; or E. Emission estimation calculation varies from the methods 
described in subsection (3)(B) of this rule. 3. The department is not limited by subparagraphs (3)(C)2.A.– 
E. of this rule in making emission fee adjustments. 4. Adjustments to data and fees will be subject to a three (3)- 
year statute of limitations unless it is— A. Due to a willful failure to report emissions or fraudulent 
representation for which there shall be no statute of limitations; or B. Adjustment of emissions is based on a permitting action under 40 CFR 52.21 for which an adjustment of fees is required to all years of emission data changed up to a maximum of ten (10) years. 40 CFR 52.21 was promulgated as of July 1, 2017 and is hereby incor- porated by reference as published by the Office of the Federal Register. Copies can be obtained from the U.S. Publishing Office Bookstore, 710 N. Capitol Street NW, Washington DC 20401. This rule does not incorporate any subsequent amendments or addi- tions. If approved, fees in effect at the time will be due, but no credit 
will be applied at the emission unit level. 
(4) Reporting and Record Keeping. All data collected and recorded in accordance with the provisions of this rule shall be retained by the owner or operator for not less than five (5) years after the end of the calendar year in which the data was collected, and all these records shall be made available upon the director’s request. 
(C) Submittal Requirements. 1. The Full Emissions Report shall be submitted either electron- 
ically via MoEIS, which requires Form 1.0 signed by an authorized company representative, or on Emissions Inventory Questionnaire (EIQ) paper forms on the frequency specified in Table 4 of this rule. Alternate methods of reporting the emissions, such as a spreadsheet file, can be submitted for approval by the director. 
2. An installation [not required to] that does not submit a Full Emissions Report is required to submit a Reduced Reporting Form, which is due April 1 after each reporting year. 
3. The Full Emissions Report is due April 1 after each reporting year. If the Full Emissions Report is filed electronically via MoEIS, this due date is extended to May 1. 
4. The installation owner or operator of record on December 31 of the reporting year is responsible for the emissions report and asso- ciated fees for the entire reporting year. 
5. If there is no production from an installation in a reporting year, no emission fees are due for that year but notice of such status must be provided to the director in writing by the emissions report due date of April 1. 
6. If an installation is out of business, the final emissions report required will be for the full or partial year the installation went out of business. Notice of such status must be provided to the director in writing by the emissions report due date of April 1. 
[7. After the effective date of this rule, any revision to the department-supplied EIQ forms will be presented to the regulated community for a forty-five (45)-day comment peri- od.]

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
10 CSR 10-6.200 Hospital, Medical, Infectious Waste Incinerators. The commission proposes to amend subsections (1)(A)–(1)(C) and (1)(I); and amend sections (2) thru (5). If the commission adopts this rule action, the department intends to submit this rule amendment to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to replace the current rule that is in the Missouri State Plan for Designated Facilities and Pollutants pursuant to section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act for Hospital, Medical, and Infectious Waste Incinerators. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking is available for viewing at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air Pollution Control Program at the address listed in the Notice of Public Hearing at the end of this rule. More information concerning this rulemaking can be found at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Proposed Rules website www.dnr.mo.gov/proposed-rules. 
PURPOSE: This rule establishes emission limits for existing hospital, medical, and infectious waste incinerators. The pollutants regulated include metals, particulate matter, acid gases, organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and opacity. This rule includes requirements for operator training and qualification, waste management, compliance and performance testing, monitoring, and reporting/record keeping. This amendment incorporates by reference the federal regulatory requirements for existing hospital, medical, and infectious waste incinerators. This rulemaking will also remove the unnecessary use of restrictive words and update/add incorporations by reference as applicable. This rulemaking will assure that state rule requirements remain consistent with the latest federal rule requirements to avoid confusion. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rule- making, per 536.016, RSMo, is the periodic rule requirement, 536.175, RSMo, and Executive Order 17-03 Red Tape Reduction Review and related comments.
