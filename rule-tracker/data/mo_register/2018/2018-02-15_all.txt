HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO 
RULES 
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system– 
Title Division Chapter Rule 
3 CSR 10- 4 .115 Department Code of Agency General area Specific area 
State Division regulated regulated Regulations 
and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115. 
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a. 
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation, for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115 NOT Rule 10-4.115. Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated. 
Code and Register on the Internet 
The Code of State Regulations and Missouri Register are available on the Internet. The Code address is www.sos.mo.gov/adrules/csr/csr The Register address is www.sos.mo.gov/adrules/moreg/moreg These websites contain rulemakings and regulations as they appear in the Code and Registers.

MISSOURI Proposed Rules February 15, 2018 REGISTER Vol. 43, No. 4 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]

Title 7—DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Division 10—Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission Chapter 8—Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program 
PROPOSED RULE 7 CSR 10-8.061 Missouri Unified Certification Program 
PURPOSE: This rule describes Missouri’s Unified Certification Program (UCP) for the United States Department of Transportation Disadvantaged Business Enterprise certifications. 
PUBLISHER’S NOTE: The secretary of state has determined that the publication of the entire text of the material which is incorporated by reference as a portion of this rule would be unduly cumbersome or expensive. This material as incorporated by reference in this rule shall be maintained by the agency at its headquarters and shall be made available to the public for inspection and copying at no more than the actual cost of reproduction. This note applies only to the ref- erence material. The entire text of the rule is printed here. 
(1) Unified Certification Program (UCP). United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) included in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 26 a provision for a “one-stop” cer- tification process for all Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs) that is required to be implemented by agencies that are recipients of federal funds from the USDOT. 
(2) Missouri Regional Certification Committee (MRCC). The Missouri Regional Certification Committee is the UCP for the state of Missouri. The five (5) agencies that directly receive USDOT funds and currently operate a USDOT approved DBE program are: 1) Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT); 2) City of St. Louis, Missouri; 3) Bi-State Development/Metro; 4) Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA); and 5) the City of Kansas City, Missouri. These entities shall be referred to as the “Direct Partners,” and are the members of the MRCC. 
(3) Unified Certification Agreement. All Direct Partners agreed to the procedures, processes, and requirements set out in the Unified Certification Agreement, Policies, and Procedures. This process allows for DBE certification by one Direct Partner to be honored by all other Direct Partners. It also allows for the review of a determi- nation of DBE ineligibility by the MRCC Direct Partners who were not involved in the decision to remove DBE eligibility. The Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission (commission) incorpo- rates by reference and makes a part of this rule the MRCC’s Unified Certification Agreement, Policies and Procedures as published by the MRCC whose address is Missouri Department of Transportation, External Civil Rights Division, 105 West Capitol Avenue, Jefferson City, MO 65102, and effective June 15, 2011. This rule does not incorporate any subsequent amendments or additions to this publica- tion. 
All final decisions to remove a DBE’s eligibility will be made by the MRCC. 
(4) Certifications, Eligibility, and Hearings. MoDOT may request a removal of a DBE’s eligibility, and such a removal shall be deter- mined by the MRCC. All initial certification denials by MoDOT are administratively appealable to the USDOT. Any hearing conducted on a DBE’s eligibility or a complaint filed against a DBE shall be conducted by the MRCC and the MRCC shall issue the decision. Such decision by the MRCC is administratively appealable to the USDOT pursuant to 49 CFR section 26.89. 
(5) NAICS Codes. The types of work a DBE firm can perform (whether on initial certification or when a new type of work is added) should be described in terms of six- (6-) digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. The MRCC will make the final determination after an informal, independent, admin- istrative review hearing after a MRCC member requests that a DBE be denied a NAICS code expansion or has a NAICS code removed. 
(6) NAICS Code Descriptions. A correct NAICS code is one that describes, as specifically as possible, the principal goods or services which the firm would provide to the USDOT recipients. The initial determination of NAICS codes will be determined by the member agency of the MRCC in receipt of the DBE firm application and occurs simultaneously with the initial determination of DBE eligibil- ity. The Bureau of Census website (www.census.gov/naics) provides additional information about the details of NAICS codes. The DBE firm has the primary responsibility to provide the detailed company information the member agency of the MRCC needs to make an appropriate NAICS code determination. 
(7) NAICS Code Descriptions Not Adequate. DBE firms shall rely on, and not depart from, the plain meaning of the NAICS code descriptions in determining the scope of a firm’s certification. However, in situations in which a DBE firm believes that the NAICS codes on record for the firm do not adequately describe the scope of the work the firm can perform, DBE firms should use the following guidance: 
(A) If a DBE firm believes that there is not a NAICS code that fully or clearly describes the type(s) of work in which it is seeking to be certified as a DBE for a commission project, the firm may request that MoDOT, in the firm’s certification documentation, sup- plement the assigned NAICS code(s) with a clear, specific, and detailed narrative description of the type of work in which the firm seeks certification. A vague, general, or confusing description is not sufficient for this purpose, and MoDOT will not rely on such a description in determining whether a firm’s desires to obtain DBE certification will be given that specific NAICS code, and, as a result, whether it’s participation may be counted toward the DBE goals established for the project. 
(B) The MRCC is not precluded from changing a NAICS code determination or description if there is a factual basis in the record resulting from the informal, independent, administrative hearing authorized in this rule for doing so. 
(8) NAICS Code Expansion Denial or Removal. If MoDOT initially denies or removes a NAICS code expansion request, the DBE firm has fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of the denial of a NAICS code expansion or removal of a NAICS code to request an informal, independent, administrative review hearing before the MRCC in the same manner as a hearing under 49 CFR section 26.87. The DBE firm must exhaust all administrative remedies with the MRCC prior to appealing a decision denying or removing of a NAICS code expansion to the USDOT. In the case of a removal of NAICS code, the DBE maintains its NAICS code unless and until a final decision of the MRCC removes such code. If the DBE firm chooses to appeal to the MRCC, it will retain its rights to any future appeals to the USDOT. In the event the DBE firm chooses to not appeal this decision to the MRCC, the DBE firm then waives its rights to appeal to the USDOT and any judicial review. If the DBE firm fails to make a timely request for an informal, independent,

administrative review by MRCC within fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of the denial of the NAICS code expansion by MoDOT, MoDOT’s decision regarding the DBE’s NAICS code expansion will be final.

(1) Overall Program Goal. (A) Amount of Goal. Missouri Department of Transportation 
(MoDOT) may use an interim goal-setting mechanism while it updates its availability calculations to set its Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goals based upon the most legally defensible methodology. MoDOT may consult with economic and statistical experts to assist in adopting a goal-setting methodology that best meets the constitutional requirements of narrow tailoring in setting MoDOT’s overall DBE goal. 
(B) Goal-Setting Process. 1. MoDOT will submit its overall DBE Program goal to the 
United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) on August 1 at three (3) year intervals, based on a schedule established by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as applicable. Before establishing the overall goal, MoDOT will consult with minority, female, and general contractor groups, community organizations, and other officials or organizations. These groups include any organization or individuals necessary to obtain informa- tion concerning the availability of disadvantaged and non-disadvan- taged businesses, the effects of discrimination on opportunities for DBEs, and MoDOT’s efforts to establish a level playing field for the participation of DBE firms in USDOT assisted contracts pertaining to highway, transit, and airport financial assistance programs. MoDOT will publish the proposed overall goal in general circulation, 
minority, and female focused publications, trade association publica- tions, and the MoDOT website. MoDOT will publish a notice of its goal-setting process by June 1 of any year an overall goal is being set, at three (3) year intervals, in order to allow thirty (30) days for inspection and public comment. 
2. Following this consultation, MoDOT will publish a notice of the proposed overall goal, informing the public that the proposed goal and its rationale are available for inspection during normal busi- ness hours at the headquarters office for thirty (30) days following the date of the notice. MoDOT and the USDOT will accept com- ments on the goals for forty-five (45) days from the date of the notice. MoDOT will plan to issue the notice by June 1 of any year an overall goal is being set, at three (3) year intervals. The notice will include addresses to which comments may be sent and addresses, including office and website addresses where the proposal may be reviewed. MoDOT will begin using the overall goal on October 1 of any year an overall goal is being set, at (3) year intervals, unless other instructions have been received from USDOT. 
3. MoDOT will include a summary of information and com- ments received during this public participation process and MoDOT’s responses in the overall goal submission to the USDOT. 
(C) Race- and Gender-Neutral Means. 1. MoDOT will strive to meet the maximum feasible portion of 
the overall DBE Program goal by race- and gender-neutral means of facilitating DBE participation in DOT assisted contracts pertaining to highway, transit, and airport financial assistance programs. Race- and gender-neutral participation involves affirmative action to assist all small business contractors and subcontractors. 
2. MoDOT will adjust the estimated breakout of race- and gen- der-neutral and race- and gender-conscious participation to reflect actual DBE participation and will track and report race- and gender- neutral and race-conscious participation separately. For reporting purposes, race- and gender-neutral DBE participation includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the following: 
A. DBE participation through a prime contract a DBE obtains through customary competitive procurement procedures; 
B. DBE participation through a subcontract that does not carry a DBE goal; 
C. DBE participation on a prime contract exceeding the con- tract DBE goal. 
(D) In order to comply with Title 49 CFR section 26.39, the department amends its current DBE program to create the following Small Business Enterprise (SBE) program for USDOT assisted pro- jects: 
1. The SBE program will not require SBE goal setting on MoDOT’s USDOT assisted projects; however, certified SBEs will be encouraged to participate and certified SBE participation will be tracked, monitored, and reported; and 
2. The Small Business Program “Declaration of Certification” form will be utilized by MoDOT as a member of the Missouri Unified Certification Program, also known as the Missouri Regional Certification Committee (MRCC). The “Declaration of Certification” is the document to be utilized by MoDOT to verify interested small businesses’ eligibility under Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations, contained in 13 CFR sections 121.101-201 as found in 15 USC 634(b) and incorporated herein by reference, to participate in the SBE Program, 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416, June 2, 2017. This rule does not incorporate any subsequent amendments or additions. 
(2) Project Goals on USDOT-Assisted Contract Work. (A) MoDOT will use contract DBE goals to meet any portion of the overall DBE goal. MoDOT does not have an expectation of being able to meet the goal using only race- and gender-neutral means. MoDOT will establish contract DBE goals only on those USDOT- 
assisted contracts with subcontracting possibilities. (B) The External Civil Rights Division is responsible for setting 
all DBE goals on MoDOT-let federal aid projects. The division is also responsible for review and concurrence on all off-state highway

system, aviation, transit, enhancement, consultant, and any other sub-recipient federal aid projects. 
(C) The DBE project goal is set by reviewing the type of project, elements of work to be performed, time frame, geographical location, history of DBE and non-DBE usage, and available DBE firms. The goal will be expressed as a percentage of the total amount of funds on a USDOT-assisted contract. 
(D) MoDOT will work to ensure that its DBE Program continues to be narrowly tailored to overcome the effects of discrimination, and MoDOT will adjust its use of contract DBE goals accordingly, as directed in 49 CFR section 26.51. MoDOT welcomes all public com- ments regarding any contract DBE goal or its contract DBE goal-set- ting processes. These comments should be made in writing and sent to MoDOT’s External Civil Rights Division at any time.

PROPOSED RESCISSION 
10 CSR 10-5.450 Control of VOC Emissions from Traffic Coatings. This rule limited volatile organic compound content of traffic coatings. If the commission adopts this rule action, the depart- ment intends to submit this rule rescission to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for removal from the Missouri State Implementation Plan. The evidence supporting the need for this pro- posed rulemaking is available for viewing at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air Pollution Control Program at the address listed in the Notice of Public Hearing at the end of this rule. More information concerning this rulemaking can be found at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Proposed Rules web- site www.dnr.mo.gov/proposed-rules. 
PURPOSE: This rule limited the volatile organic compound content of traffic coatings. Volatile organic compounds are precursors to ozone, which pose health and environmental concerns. The purpose of this rulemaking is to rescind a state rule that is duplicative of a federal rule and, therefore, no longer necessary. The evidence sup- porting the need for this proposed rulemaking, per 536.016, RSMo, is 536.175, RSMo and Executive Order 17-03 Red Tape Reduction Review and related comments. 
AUTHORITY: section 643.050, RSMo 1994. Original rule filed Oct. 7, 1994, effective May 28, 1995. Rescinded: Filed Jan. 4, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rescission will not cost state agencies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed rescission will not cost private enti- ties more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING AND NOTICE TO SUBMIT COM- MENTS: A public hearing on this proposed rescission will begin at 9:00 a.m., March 29, 2018.

Proposed Rules 
February 15, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 4 
February 15, 2018 Orders of Rulemaking MISSOURI Vol. 43, No. 4 REGISTER 

This section will contain the final text of the rules proposed by agencies. The order of rulemaking is required to con- tain a citation to the legal authority upon which the order of rulemaking is based; reference to the date and page or pages where the notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Missouri Register; an explanation of any change between the text of the rule as contained in the notice of proposed rule- making and the text of the rule as finally adopted, together with the reason for any such change; and the full text of any section or subsection of the rule as adopted which has been changed from that contained in the notice of proposed rule- making. The effective date of the rule shall be not less than thirty (30) days after the date of publication of the revision to the Code of State Regulations. 
The agency is also required to make a brief summary of the general nature and extent of comments submitted in support of or opposition to the proposed rule and a concise summary of the testimony presented at the hearing, if any, held in connection with the rulemaking, together with a con- cise summary of the agency’s findings with respect to the merits of any such testimony or comments which are opposed in whole or in part to the proposed rule.

Title 15—ELECTED OFFICIALS Division 30—Secretary of State Chapter 120—Family Trust Company 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the secretary of state under section 362.1116, RSMo Supp. 2017, the secretary adopts a rule as follows: 
15 CSR 30-120.010 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on September 15, 2017 (42 MoReg 1318). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The secretary of state received two (2) comments on the proposed rule. Because of these comments, changes were made to this rule. 
COMMENT #1: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, noted that this rule introduces the definition of a “holding company,” which is then used in the Application to Register as a Family Trust Company. The Application to Register as a Family Trust Company requires additional information for any holding company that will be subscribing to ten percent (10%) or more of the stock or membership interests. Mr. Redd suggested that to collect and provide this infor- mation is unnecessary and time-consuming, and that the Missouri Family Trust Company Act does not require the secretary to collect information about holding companies. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The proposed 
modification is appropriate and secretary will delete the definition of “holding company.” 
COMMENT #2: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that this rule also introduces the definition of a “third- party service provider.” Under 15 CSR 30-120.050, a family trust company would be required to maintain a list identifying all third- party service providers and the services they provide as part of the records kept at the family trust company’s principal place of business in Missouri. Mr. Redd contends that the Missouri Family Trust Company Act does not require the secretary to mandate family trust companies to maintain such lists, and that requiring a family trust company to maintain such lists is unnecessary and time-consuming. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The proposed modification is appropriate and secretary will delete the definition of “third-party service provider.” 
15 CSR 30-120.010 Definitions 
(1) As used in this chapter or in the forms prescribed by this chapter, the words defined in section 362.1015, RSMo, shall have the same meaning, and the following terms and phrases (whether or not capi- talized) shall have the meanings stated below unless the context clear- ly indicates otherwise: 
(D) “Company” means any corporation, association, partnership, limited liability company, business trust, sole proprietorship, joint venture, or charitable organization or foundation, or other similar organization or business entity; and 
(E) “Owns” or “controls” means owns, controls, or has power to vote twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of voting secu- rities or membership interests of a company or family trust company or foreign family trust company; or controls in any manner the elec- tion of a majority of the directors, or managers or other similar gov- erning body of a company or family trust company or foreign family trust company; owns, controls, or has power to vote ten percent (10%) or more of any class of voting securities or membership inter- ests of a company or family trust company or foreign family trust company and exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the company or family trust company or foreign family trust company; or as determined by the secretary. 
Title 15—ELECTED OFFICIALS Division 30—Secretary of State Chapter 120—Family Trust Company 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the secretary of state under section 362.1116, RSMo Supp. 2017, the secretary adopts a rule as follows: 
15 CSR 30-120.020 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on September 15, 2017 (42 MoReg 1318–1319). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after pub- lication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The secretary received eighteen (18) comments on the proposed rule. Because of these comments, changes were made to this rule. 
COMMENT #1: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, recommended that the first sentence of section (1) be changed to “An applicant seeking to register as...”

Orders of Rulemaking 

RESPONSE: Under section 362.1015, RSMo, the term “family trust company” is defined. The proposed change is unnecessary. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #2: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that the language used in the rule should be consistent with the statute and other rules, including the language used to describe records and fees. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change proposed will be adopted. In section (1), “application fee” will be changed to “filing fee” and in subsection (2)(D) and section (4), “corporate” will be changed to “company.” The Application to Register as a Family Trust Company will be amended to reflect this change and the revision number will be changed from revised 08/2017 to revised 12/2017. 
COMMENT #3: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that section (4) incorrectly referenced Exhibit G. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change proposed will be adopted and the reference will be corrected. 
COMMENT #4: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that a large portion of the information required by the secretary to be submitted with the Application to Register as a Family Trust Company is not required by the Missouri Family Trust Company Act (e.g., numbers 8, 9, 13, 14, and 16 and exhibits A, B, D, E, F, and G), and that the extent of information required is oppressive. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Under section 362.1030.2, RSMo, no family trust company shall conduct business in Missouri unless such family trust company pays a filing fee and registers with the secretary in a format prescribed by the secretary. Under section 362.1085, RSMo, the secretary may establish by rule the requirements and records necessary to demonstrate conformity with sections 362.1010 to 362.1117, RSMo, by a family trust com- pany. Under section 362.1110, RSMo, a family trust company shall keep at its principal place of business or principal place of opera- tions: full and complete records of the names and residences of all its shareholders or members; the number of shares or membership units held by each, as applicable; and the ownership percentage of each shareholder or member. Under section 362.1035.2, RSMo, a family trust company is required to maintain applicable state and local busi- ness licenses, charters, and permits; and a deposit account with a state-chartered or national financial institution that has a principal or branch office in Missouri. Under 362.1050, RSMo, a family trust company must maintain its fiduciary books and records separate and distinct from other records of the company and shall segregate all assets held in any fiduciary capacity from other assets of the compa- ny. The secretary reviewed the Application to Register as a Family Trust Company and determined that the amount of information requested could be reduced. The secretary removed the information requested from number 9, Exhibit B, and Exhibit E. The Application to Register as a Family Trust Company will be amended to reflect these changes and the revision number will be changed from revised 08/2017 to revised 12/2017. 
COMMENT #5: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that number 8, Family Members, of the Application to Register as a Family Trust Company includes incorrect statutory ref- erences for “natural persons” and “entities.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change proposed will be adopted and the references will be corrected. The Application to Register as a Family Trust Company will be amended to reflect this change and the revision number will be changed from revised 08/2017 to revised 12/2017. 
COMMENT #6: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, inquired about whether the family members to be listed in the 
Application to Register as a Family Trust Company are all family members or just those to be served by the family trust company? RESPONSE: Under section 362.1015, RSMo, the term “family member” is defined, the Application to Register as a Family Trust Company requests information about those family members to be served by the family trust company at the time of application. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #7: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that the Missouri Family Trust Company Act does not require family members to be listed in the Application to Register as a Family Trust Company, and that some of the information requested may be unavailable when the Application to Register as a Family Trust Company is submitted. 
RESPONSE: Under section 362.1030.2, RSMo, no family trust company shall conduct business in Missouri unless such family trust company pays a filing fee and registers with the secretary in a format prescribed by the secretary. Under section 362.1085, RSMo, the sec- retary may establish by rule the requirements and records necessary to demonstrate conformity with sections 362.1010 to 362.1117, RSMo, by a family trust company.

COMMENT #8: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, stated that with some families the Genealogical Chart could be very difficult to assemble, and it is not required by the Missouri Family Trust Company Act. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change proposed will be adopted. The secretary will remove the requirement of filing a Genealogical Chart in the Application to Register as a Family Trust Company. The Application to Register as a Family Trust Company will be amended to reflect this change and the revi- sion number will be changed from revised 08/2017 to revised 12/2017. 
COMMENT #9: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that number 10, Organizational Instrument, of the Application to Register as a Family Trust Company should be expanded to include the information required by section 362.1030.3, RSMo, and Chapter 347 or 351, as applicable.

COMMENT #11: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that number 12, Directors or Managers, of the Application to Register as a Family Trust Company states that “Missouri resident” is defined in 15 CSR 30-120.010, but “Missouri resident” is not therein defined. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change proposed will be adopted and the reference will be removed. The Application to Register as a Family Trust Company will be amended to reflect this change and the revision number will be changed from revised 08/2017 to revised 12/2017.

COMMENT #16: Charles A.

RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Under section 362.1110, RSMo, a family trust company shall keep at its principal place of business or principal place of operations: full and complete records of the names and residences of all its shareholders or mem- bers; the number of shares or membership units held by each, as applicable; and the ownership percentage of each shareholder or member.

rule was published in the Missouri Register on September 15, 2017 (42 MoReg 1319). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The secretary of state received three (3) comments on the proposed rule. Because of these comments, changes were made to this rule. 
COMMENT #1: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that the language used to describe the fee should be con- sistent with the statute and other rules. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change proposed will be adopted. In section (1), “application fee” will be changed to “filing fee.” The Application to Register as a Foreign Family Trust Company will be amended to reflect this change and the revision number will be changed from revised 08/2017 to revised 12/2017. 
COMMENT #2: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that the introductory language regarding “Authorized Representative” in the Application to Register as a Foreign Family Trust Company uses the phrase “if the proposed foreign family trust company will be organized as...;” however, a foreign family trust company will already have been organized under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it then already exists at the time the application is filed. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The proposed modification is appropriate, and the Application to Register as a Foreign Family Trust Company will be amended to reflect this change and the revision number will be changed from revised 08/2017 to revised 12/2017. 
COMMENT #3: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that the Application to Register as a Foreign Family Trust Company uses the term “principal jurisdiction,” without defin- ing such term, instead of “jurisdiction of incorporation or organiza- tion” (which is the phrase used in the Missouri Family Trust Company Act (section 362.1030.5, RSMo.)). Mr. Redd suggested that the language in the application should be consistent with corre- sponding language in the Act. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The proposed modification is appropriate, and the Application to Register as a Foreign Family Trust Company will be amended to reflect this change and the revision number will be changed from revised 08/2017 to revised 12/2017. 
15 CSR 30-120.030 Application to Register as a Foreign Family Trust Company

Title 15—ELECTED OFFICIALS Division 30—Secretary of State Chapter 120—Family Trust Company 
By the authority vested in the secretary of state under sections 362.1055 and 362.1116, RSMo Supp. 2017, the secretary adopts a rule as follows: 
15 CSR 30-120.040 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on September 15, 2017 (42 MoReg 1320). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The secretary of state received nine (9) comments on the proposed rule. Because of these comments, changes were made to this rule. 
COMMENT #1: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that the language used to describe the fee should be “annual registration” fee instead of “application” fee. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: To be consistent with the statute and the other rules, the language will be changed to “annual filing” fee. 
COMMENT #2: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, suggested that the Annual Registration Report use the term “family trust company that is not a foreign family trust” company instead of “family trust company.” 
RESPONSE: Under section 362.1015, RSMo, the terms “family trust company” and “foreign family trust company” are defined terms. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this com- ment. 
COMMENT #3: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, suggested that the Annual Registration Report requests information that is unnecessary, time-consuming, and beyond what is required by section 362.1055, RSMo. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The secretary reviewed the Annual Registration Report and determined that for most questions a company could check a box if no changes had occurred since the end of the prior calendar year. The secretary also amended the Annual Registration Report to reduce the amount of information requested consistent with amendments made to the Application to Register as a Family Trust Company. The Annual Registration Report will be amended to reflect these changes and the revision number will be changed from revised 08/2017 to revised 12/2017. 
COMMENT #4: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, noted that number 7 of the Annual Registration Report asks if there has been a change in the designated relative and, if so, to explain. Section 362.1055.2, RSMo, requires that the annual registration of a family trust company that is not a foreign family trust company to list the name of the designated relative. Mr Redd contends that unless or until the identity of the designated relative changes, the annual reg- istration report will never have divulged who the designated relative is. 
RESPONSE: The Application to Register as a Family Trust Company requires information regarding the designated relative, and the Annual Registration Report requires the family trust company to update the family trust company’s designated relative if there has been a change since the end of the prior calendar year. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #5: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, noted that number 8 of the Annual Registration Report uses the term “principal jurisdiction” without defining such term, instead of “juris- diction of incorporation or organization.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change

proposed will be adopted. The Annual Registration Report will be amended to reflect this change and the revision number will be changed from revised 08/2017 to revised 12/2017. 
COMMENT #6: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, noted that the Certification in the Annual Registration Report incor- rectly uses the term “applicant” instead of “family trust company,” “foreign family trust company,” or “company,” as context requires. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change pro- posed will be adopted. The Annual Registration Report will be amended to reflect this change and the revision number will be changed from revised 08/2017 to revised 12/2017. 
COMMENT #7: The staff of the secretary of state suggested deleting the word “applicant’s” and the phrase “the applicant has provided” from the General Instructions section of the Annual Registration Report.

ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the secretary of state under sections 362.1085.5 and 362.1116, RSMo Supp. 2017, the secretary adopts a rule as follows: 
15 CSR 30-120.050 is adopted. A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed 
rule was published in the Missouri Register on September 15, 2017 (42 MoReg 1320–1321). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after pub- lication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The secretary of state received seven (7) comments on the proposed rule. Because of these comments, changes were made to this rule. 
COMMENT #1: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, asked if the information required to be maintained under section (2) was only required to be maintained by a family trust company that is not a foreign family trust company. 
RESPONSE: The information required to be maintained by a family trust company is listed under section (2), and the information required to be maintained by a foreign family trust company is listed under section (4). Context indicates that as used in section (2) the term family trust company does not include a foreign family trust company. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #2: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, requested that the secretary consider whether a timeline beyond which certain information needs to be retained could be established. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Section 362.1110.2, RSMo, requires the secretary retain records for at least ten (10) years. Sections (2) and (4) will be amended to state that each family trust company and foreign family trust company shall retain the records for at least ten (10) years. 
COMMENT #3: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, requested clarification on whether the term “corporate investments” used in subsection (2)(B) meant all investments owned by the family trust company in its corporate or LLC capacity other than its capital account. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The term will be changed to “company investments” and includes all investments owned by the family trust company in its corporate or LLC capacity. 
COMMENT #4: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, suggested that the phrase: “The results of and all information pertain- ing to” be added to subsection (2)(G). RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change pro- posed will be adopted.

Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, suggested that section (4) be revised to require foreign family trust companies to maintain the names and addresses of all stockholders or members of the trust company and the number of shares of stock or membership units held by each, as well as the ownership percentages of each stockholder or member as required under section 362.1110, RSMo. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change pro- posed will be adopted. 
COMMENT #6: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that with some families the Genealogical Chart could be very difficult to assemble, and it is not required by the Missouri Family Trust Company Act. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change pro- posed will be adopted, and a current genealogical chart or table that includes and identifies all family members will be deleted from sec- tion (2). 
COMMENT #7: Charles A. Redd, with Stinson Leonard Street LLP, commented that under the rule a family trust company would be required to maintain a list identifying all third-party service providers and the services they provide as part of the records kept at the family

Orders of Rulemaking 

trust company’s principal place of business in Missouri. Mr. Redd contends that the Missouri Family Trust Company Act does not require the secretary to mandate family trust companies to maintain such lists, and that requiring a family trust company to maintain such lists is unnecessary and time-consuming. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change proposed will be adopted, and a list identifying all third-party service providers and the services provided will be deleted from sections (2) and (4). 
15 CSR 30-120.050 Records
