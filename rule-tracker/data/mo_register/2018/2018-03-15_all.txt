SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: A public hearing on this proposed amendment was held November 21, 2017, and the public comment period ended November 28, 2017. At the public hearing, department staff explained the proposed amendment and thirteen (13) comments were made. The department also received thirty (30) written com- ments from thirty-five (35) individuals, municipalities, and organiza- tions during the public comment period. The department’s responses to these comments have been categorized as general and specific. The term “lakes” refers to both “lakes and reservoirs,” except where noted.
PUBLIC HEARING COMMENTS:
COMMENT #1: Rocky Miller, professional engineer and Representative for District 124, asked staff to be careful about how this amendment is written, because future staff and boards will be the ones enforcing the rules. Representative Miller stated that the department should develop rules because they make a difference, rather than because they are told to do so. Representative Miller also asked that costs be kept in mind.
RESPONSE: Representative Miller’s comments are appreciated. The proposed amendment is the result of years of stakeholder discussions. The most significant component of the proposed amendment is the revision of disapproved numeric nutrient criteria, criteria that have been the subject of litigation involving the Missouri Coalition for the Environment and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The department believes that it is in the state’s best inter- est to adopt this amendment to avoid promulgation at the federal level. Furthermore, the proposed amendment is the appropriate mechanism for protecting Missouri’s water quality. The proposed numeric nutrient criteria will protect Missouri’s lakes using Missouri-specific data and methods to ensure appropriate water qual- ity protections. As part of its rulemaking effort, the department con- sidered economic costs and benefits associated with the proposed amendment revisions through a Regulatory Impact Report (RIR). An initial public comment period for the RIR was held from July 24, 2017 through September 22, 2017. Following revisions to the draft rule, the RIR was modified and a second public comment period was held from September 25, 2017 through November 24, 2017. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.

  COMMENT #2: Leslie Holloway, Missouri Farm Bureau, comment- ed that there is a court order in place and that the department must act in developing numeric nutrient criteria for lakes, otherwise crite- ria will be promulgated by the USEPA. Holloway stated the proposed nutrient criteria address many of Farm Bureau’s concerns and urged the Clean Water Commission to support it. Holloway further stated that numeric nutrient criteria are not necessary to achieve the state’s nutrient management goals.
RESPONSE: The department agrees that it is in Missouri’s best interest to amend this rule to avoid promulgation at the federal level. As noted by the commenter, numeric nutrient criteria are required as a result of recent litigation that obligates the USEPA to propose numeric nutrient criteria for Missouri lakes if the state does not do so. Federal litigation notwithstanding, federal regulations at 40 CFR section 131.22 require states to adopt water quality criteria that pro- tect designated uses. In addition to protecting designated uses, the proposed numeric nutrient criteria are necessary to provide a means for water quality assessment as well as to provide targets for water quality restoration. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #3: Jay Hoskins, Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District, supports the comments submitted by the Association of Missouri Cleanwater Agencies (AMCA). Hoskins supports the proposed numeric nutrient criteria, especially for allowing a framework that considers numeric threshold and bioconfirmation response variables to assess use attainment.
RESPONSE: The department appreciates the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District’s support and will carefully consider the comments submitted by the AMCA. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #4: Darrick Steen, Missouri Corn Growers Association and Missouri Soybean Association, noted that there is a court order in place and that the department must act in developing numeric nutrient criteria for lakes, otherwise criteria will be promulgated by the USEPA. Steen also expressed concerns that the proposed numeric nutrient criteria may result in perpetual water quality impairments of northern Missouri lakes and that these concerns should be addressed by the department during implementation. Steen asked that the department give maximum flexibility in regards to assessment and restoration.
RESPONSE: The department agrees that it is in the state’s best inter- est to adopt this amendment to avoid promulgation at the federal level. The department will complete water quality assessments in accordance with established listing methodologies on a biennial basis as part of its Clean Water Act sections 305(b) and 303(d) reporting efforts. Both future listing methodology documents and 303(d) lists of impaired waters will be developed with input from stakeholders and the interested public. The department will consider restoration efforts through an adaptive implementation approach that makes progress toward achieving water quality goals while using new data and information to adjust implementation activities. The department will, through the triennial review process, continue to evaluate the appropriateness of existing water quality standards and may consider site-specific criteria based on a sound scientific rationale that protects designated uses as allowed by federal regulations at 40 CFR 131.11(b)(1)(ii). No changes have been made as a result of this com- ment.
COMMENT #5: Dee Dokken, Sierra Club, commented in opposi- tion to the proposed numeric nutrient criteria for lakes, because it does not provide protections for drinking water supply and recre- ational designated uses. Dokken stated that the proposed amendment uses a reactionary approach that is not consistent with the Clean Water Act. Dokken further stated that lakes are an economic boon to Missouri and more money should be invested to protect them. RESPONSE: The department revised the draft rule to remove the
drinking water supply use criteria. Stakeholders had requested the department reevaluate the necessity of those criteria given the pro- posed aquatic life use criteria also would be protective of the drinking water supply use. Stakeholders had also raised concerns that the pro- posed raw drinking water source criteria were developed using a potentially overly conservative approach based on finished drinking water levels. The department notes that the criteria derived for the protection of aquatic life uses in lakes located within the Ozark Highlands and Ozark Border ecoregions are more protective than the proposed drinking water supply use criteria and therefore, protective of both designated uses. For lakes in the Plains ecoregion, the differ- ence in the chlorophyll-a criterion proposed for aquatic life protec- tions, 30 μg/L, and the criterion proposed for drinking water supply protections, 25 μg/L, is 5 μg/L. Recognizing that the drinking water supply use as defined in 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(C)6. applies to raw water which will yield potable water after treatment by public water treatment facilities (emphasis added), the department determined that the 5 μg/L difference will not significantly affect the ability of drink- ing water treatment operations to provide drinking water that meets Safe Drinking Water standards. As noted in research cited with the proposed amendment, microcystins were not detected in Missouri reservoirs eighty percent (80%) of the time (one thousand three hun- dred thirty-one (1,331) non-detects out of one thousand six hundred fifty-eight (1,658) samples); where detected, they generally were found at low levels. Microcystin concentrations in raw water greater than 0.3 μg/L (n = 140), the USEPA health advisory level for bot- tle-fed infants and young children for finished drinking water, occurred in less than ten percent (10%) of the samples with a median chlorophyll-a concentration of 33.5 μg/L. The 30-μg/L chlorophyll- a criterion proposed for aquatic life in the Plains ecoregion, which would apply to raw drinking water sources, ensures the probability of microcystin occurrence for finished water is less than ten percent (10%). Therefore, the aquatic life criterion adequately protects drinking water sources from impairment with respect to the algal toxin microcystin. Data continues to be gathered on algal toxins in Missouri lakes, with a second toxin (cylindrospermopsin) being mon- itored in addition to microcystin during the 2017 summer season. The department is in discussions with the University of Missouri Limnology Laboratory to also add saxitoxin and anatoxin-a analyses to the lake monitoring programs. These additional data will help clar- ify the extent of algal toxins in Missouri’s lakes. The department also continues to grow its understanding of both the factors that drive toxin production and the efficiencies of treatment in removing algal toxins from source water. These efforts will enable the state to better address drinking water protection during a future rulemaking.
Although specific criteria for the protection of recreational uses are not specified, the inclusion of both causal and response threshold values provides additional water quality protections. Research and information continue to develop at the national level with respect to nutrient impacts and criteria for the protection of recreational uses. Missouri intends to consider numeric nutrient criteria for recreation- al designated uses during a future rulemaking. This effort will allow studies currently underway by USEPA and others on the effects of cyanotoxins on recreational uses to mature, and for the state to con- duct user perception surveys of algae by the recreating public.
The department agrees that numeric nutrient criteria are an impor- tant component of a healthy Missouri environment that will support and sustain a healthy economy. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #6: Chao Qu, Interdisciplinary Environmental Clinic of Washington University on behalf of the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, opposes the proposed amendment because the pro- posed numeric nutrient criteria for lakes do not do enough to protect aquatic life. Qu stated the proposed criteria focuses on protecting sport fish, but not other aquatic life species including the most sen- sitive species. Qu requests the department reconsider the proposed criteria for aquatic life.

 Orders of Rulemaking
  RESPONSE: The proposed numeric nutrient criteria were derived based on trophic status ranges by ecoregion. The richest diversity index from each ecoregion was used as the target for the trophic sta- tus based on a corresponding range of chlorophyll-a. The criteria were derived by finding the level of algal growth that promotes sus- tainable biotic diversity by being neither a limiting factor from its scarcity nor a limiting factor from its obstructive presence in large quantities. Using sport fishery status as an indicator of aquatic life use protection is ecologically justified because sport fish are gener- ally apex predators in reservoir systems. The department’s findings show that the health of sport fish populations can be interpreted as an indicator of overall ecosystem health and the presence of a wide variety of aquatic biota, which is consistent with 10 CSR 20- 7.031(1)(C)1.A and 40 CFR 131.11(a). No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #7: Steve Taylor, Missouri Agribusiness Association, commented on the distinction between human-made reservoirs and lakes. Taylor stated that Missouri scientists have collected significant data on these reservoirs and have determined what is best for sport- fish. Taylor also commented that the proposed numeric nutrient cri- teria for lakes are protective, if not overprotective, of these species. Taylor does not oppose the proposed amendment changes and urges the commission to go forward.
RESPONSE: The department appreciates the Missouri Agribusiness Association’s recommendation for moving forward with the proposed rule amendments and agrees that the proposed numeric nutrient cri- teria are protective of designated aquatic life uses. Missouri used a robust dataset comprised of nutrient related measurements from over two hundred (200) reservoirs throughout the state to support the development of reservoir nutrient criteria. This dataset includes over thirty-two thousand (32,000) records of chlorophyll and nutrient data, making it one (1) of the largest datasets used for criteria deriva- tion. The data originated from various University of Missouri pro- grams and special studies, but most notably from the Lakes of Missouri Volunteer Monitoring Program (LMVP) and the Statewide Lake Assessment Program (SLAP). Using sport fishery status as an indicator of aquatic life use protection is ecologically justified because sport fish are generally apex predators in reservoir systems. The department’s findings show that the health of sport fish popula- tions can be interpreted as an indicator of overall ecosystem health and the presence of a wide variety of aquatic biota, which is consis- tent with 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(C)1.A and 40 CFR 131.11(a). No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #8: Sydney Welter, Interdisciplinary Environmental Clinic of Washington University on behalf of the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, expressed concern that the proposed numeric nutrient criteria do not protect human health and lack criteria for drinking water supply and recreational designated uses. Welter com- mented that USEPA stated in a 2016 letter that the department’s nutrient criteria should protect recreational uses. Welter urged the department to include criteria for the protection of recreational and drinking water supply designated uses.
RESPONSE: The department revised the draft amendment to remove the drinking water supply use criteria. Stakeholders had requested the department reevaluate the necessity of those criteria given the proposed aquatic life use criteria also would be protective of the drinking water supply use. Stakeholders had also raised concerns that the proposed raw drinking water source criteria were developed using a potentially overly conservative approach based on finished drinking water levels. The department notes that the criteria derived for the protection of aquatic life uses in lakes located within the Ozark Highlands and Ozark Border ecoregions are more protective than the proposed drinking water supply use criteria and is therefore protec- tive of both designated uses. For lakes in the Plains ecoregion, the difference in the chlorophyll-a criterion proposed for aquatic life pro- tections, 30 μg/L, and the criterion proposed for drinking water sup-
ply protections, 25 μg/L, is 5 μg/L. Recognizing that the drinking water supply use as defined in 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(C)6. applies to raw water which will yield potable water after treatment by public water treatment facilities (emphasis added), the department deter- mined that the 5 μg/L difference will not significantly affect the abil- ity of drinking water treatment operations to provide drinking water that meets Safe Drinking Water standards. As noted in research cited with the proposed amendment, microcystins were not detected in Missouri reservoirs eighty percent (80%) of the time (one thousand three hundred thirty-one (1,331) non-detects out of one thousand six hundred fifty-eight (1,658) samples); where detected, they generally were found at low levels. Microcystin concentrations in raw water greater than 0.3 μg/L (n = 140), the USEPA health advisory level for bottle-fed infants and young children for finished drinking water, occurred in less than ten percent (10%) of the samples with a median chl-a concentration of 33.5 μg/L. The 30-μg/L chlorophyll-a criteri- on proposed for aquatic life in the Plains ecoregion, which would apply to raw drinking water sources, ensures the probability of microcystin occurrence for finished water is less than ten percent (10%). Therefore, the aquatic life criterion adequately protects drinking water sources from impairment with respect to the algal toxin microcystin. Data continues to be gathered on algal toxins in Missouri lakes, with a second toxin (cylindrospermopsin) being mon- itored in addition to microcystin during the 2017 summer season. The department is in discussions with the University of Missouri Limnology Laboratory to also add saxitoxin and anatoxin-a analyses to the lake monitoring programs. These additional data will help clarify the extent of algal toxins in Missouri’s lakes. The department also continues to grow its understanding of both the factors that drive toxin production and the efficiencies of treatment in removing algal toxins from source water. These efforts will enable the state to better address drinking water protection during a future rulemaking.
Research and information continue to develop at the national level with respect to nutrient impacts and criteria for the protection of recreational uses. Missouri intends to pursue numeric nutrient crite- ria for recreational designated uses during a future rulemaking. This effort will allow studies currently underway by USEPA and others on the effects of cyanotoxins on recreational uses to mature, and for the state to conduct user perception surveys of algae by the recreating public. Although specific criteria for the protection of recreational uses are not specified, the inclusion of both causal and response threshold values provides additional water quality protections. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #9: Mollie Carroll, Interdisciplinary Environmental Clinic of Washington University on behalf of the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, expressed concern about the reliance of narra- tive values for making impairment decisions. Carrol commented that the five (5) proposed eutrophication factors are ill-defined, subjec- tive, reactive in nature, and do not protect Missouri’s lakes. Carroll stated that the lack of definition of the word excursion within the amendment means that interpretations can differ. Similarly, that excessive turbidity is not defined and suggests that Secchi depth would provide a stronger indicator. Carroll also states that the depart- ment should provide unique cyanobacteria criteria for aquatic life rather than relying on USEPA’s Risk Assessment on Human Health. RESPONSE: As noted by the commenter, the proposed numeric nutrient criteria include five (5) eutrophication factors on which impairment decisions will be based. The use of these eutrophication factors provides a weight-of-evidence approach that uses nutrient response conditions that indicate impairment in conjunction with nutrient screening thresholds. No definition of excursion criteria is required, because the rule language references the specific criteria for both pH and dissolved oxygen. These criteria can be found in 10 CSR 20-7.031(5)(E) and 10 CSR 20-7.031(5)(J) respectively. In addition, exceedance rates from water quality standards that result in impairment are presented in the department’s Listing Methodology Document. Because water quality assessments are completed on a

  March 15, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 6
  Missouri Register
Page 593
  biennial basis as part of its Clean Water Act sections 305(b) and 303(d) reporting efforts, the listing methodology document is the appropriate location for such references. Cyanobacteria counts pre- sented in the proposed amendment were not derived from a USEPA document for acute human health criteria, but instead cell count val- ues were derived as outlined in the “Rationale for Missouri Numeric Nutrient Criteria for Lakes, Nov. 21, 2016” on page 44, which was made available online during the public comment period with other reference documents. The use of mineral turbidity as an eutrophica- tion factor is appropriate as it has been documented that mineral tur- bidity can have a negative effect on algal production, thereby inhibit- ing chlorophyll-a production that, if looked at alone, would obscure a water quality impairment. Although the use of a Secchi disk is one approach for measuring turbidity, the department will continue to evaluate other approaches as well for possible relationships between total suspended solids and chlorophyll-a production when developing future listing methodology documents. Future listing methodology documents to implement the numeric nutrient criteria for assessment purposes will be developed with input from stakeholders and the interested public. No changes have been made as a result of this com- ment.
COMMENT #10: Robert Brundage, Newman, Comley & Ruth on behalf of Associated Industries of Missouri, commented on the pro- posed 304(a) criteria. Brundage recommends the department hold off on adopting the 304(a) criteria, because USEPA is in the process of updating some of the criteria. Brundage commented that assumptions regarding the consumption of fish and water were adopted without studying Missourian’s rates and expressed concern that the human health protection designated use extended to all Missouri Use Designation Dataset (MUDD) waters. Brundage also commented that many of the 304(a) criteria are more stringent and the fiscal note pre- sumes no fiscal impact.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGES: Because of the concerns from the Associated Industries of Missouri and other stake- holders, the department is withdrawing the updated 304(a) Human Health Protection uses and associated criteria. This includes both the Organism Only and Organism + Water uses. The department will reevaluate the appropriateness of these criteria in Missouri’s Water Quality Standards during its next triennial review. The existing Human Health Protection – Fish Consumption use and associated criteria will remain in Missouri’s Water Quality Standards.
COMMENT #11: Trent Stober, HDR Engineering, commented that it is important that the state stays in control of its own programs and base lake nutrient criteria on information collected in the state. Stober stated the proposed criteria are an improvement over the cri- teria that were disapproved by USEPA in 2011. Stober suggested clarifications to the proposed amendment that would provide clarifi- cation without modifying the intent.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGES: The depart- ment appreciates HDR’s support of the proposed Water Quality Standards amendment and agrees that it is in the state’s best interest to adopt this amendment to avoid promulgation at the federal level. The department agrees that the suggested formatting and terminology changes provided by HDR will improve the clarity of the proposed nutrient criteria without changing its intent and have therefore incor- porated these changes into the amendment. The department has also included additional clarification in regard to its responsibility to col- lect sufficient data and information from which to assess response assessment endpoints (i.e., eutrophication impacts).
COMMENT #12: Paul Calamita, general counsel for the AMCA, commented that the AMCA strives for balanced regulation, which needs to be affordable, cost-effective, and protective. Calamita fur- ther commented that there shouldn’t be a one-size-fits-all approach and that the proposed numeric nutrient criteria were a compromise. Calamita stated that other non-nutrient changes to the rule correct
legacy provisions that are wrong and should be corrected. Calamita urges adoption of the amendment.
RESPONSE: The department appreciates the AMCA’s support and acknowledgement that the proposed amendment is an attempt to reach a compromise position satisfactory to all interested parties while still being adequately protective of designated uses. The department developed numeric nutrient criteria through a stakeholder process using Missouri specific data in order to ensure an appropriate level of protection for Missouri lakes. Missouri used a robust dataset comprised of nutrient related measurements from over two hundred (200) reservoirs throughout the state to support the development of reservoir nutrient criteria. This dataset includes over thirty-two thou- sand (32,000) records of chlorophyll and nutrient data, making it one (1) of the largest datasets used for criteria derivation. The data orig- inated from various University of Missouri programs and special studies, but most notably from the LMVP and the SLAP. The depart- ment agrees that removal of outdated or disapproved criteria from the Water Quality Standards is appropriate and necessary. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #13: Kevin Perry, REGFORM, expressed support for the proposed numeric nutrient criteria for lakes. Perry also expressed support for proposed changes to calculating hardness values and mix- ing zone requirements. Perry expressed concern about proposed 304(a) criteria associated with human health protection. Perry sug- gested the rule clarify that the organism plus water values should apply to waters designated with the drinking water supply use and not all waters. Perry also recommended that the proposed 304(a) criteria for the protection of human health be removed. Perry asked the com- mission to not adopt the twenty-two (22) grams per day fish con- sumption level or the 2.4 liter per day water consumption level. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGES: The depart- ment appreciates the support for changes associated with hardness values and mixing zone requirements. Because of REGFORM’s and other stakeholders’ concerns, the department is withdrawing inclu- sion of 304(a) criteria associated with human health protections. The department will reevaluate the appropriateness of these criteria in Missouri’s Water Quality Standards during its next triennial review.
GENERAL WRITTEN COMMENTS:
GENERAL WRITTEN COMMENT #1: Support for the proposed numeric nutrient criteria for lakes: Comments received from the AMCA, the City of Independence, the City of Springfield, Daniel M. Kelly, Little Blue Valley Sewer District, Missouri Municipal League, and REGFORM provided general support for the proposed numeric nutrient criteria for lakes. In a similar comment, the Missouri Farm Bureau commented in support of the department’s decision to move forward with the proposed numeric nutrient criteria in light of the lit- igation against USEPA to promulgate criteria if the state does not. HDR also commented in support of the proposed nutrient criteria, but also provided recommendations for revising the rule language to provide additional clarity and to more closely align the terminology and structure with USEPA’s bioconfirmation approach, i.e., “Guiding Principles on an Optional Approach for Developing and Implementing a Numeric Nutrient Criterion that Integrates Causal and Response Parameters (USEPA-820-F-13-039, September 2013).” RESPONSE: The department appreciates the support for the pro- posed numeric nutrient criteria for lakes. The department is propos- ing numeric nutrient criteria for lakes in order to address USEPA’s August 2011 disapproval of proposed numeric nutrient criteria for lakes at 10 CSR 20-7.031(3)(N). 40 CFR section 131.22 states that if states do not adopt changes to water quality standards as a result of USEPA disapproval, then the USEPA shall propose and promul- gate such standards. The department agrees that it is in the state’s best interest to adopt this rule to avoid promulgation at the federal level. The department developed these criteria through a stakeholder process using Missouri specific data in order to ensure an appropriate

 Orders of Rulemaking
  level of protection for Missouri lakes. The proposal responds to the agency’s disapproval and concerns expressed in May 2016 by provid- ing a nutrient criteria framework that is scientifically rigorous, repro- ducible, and connected to the aquatic life protection designated use. Missouri used a robust dataset comprised of nutrient related mea- surements from over two hundred (200) reservoirs throughout the state to support the development of reservoir nutrient criteria. This dataset includes over thirty-two thousand (32,000) records of chloro- phyll and nutrient data, making it one of the largest datasets used for criteria derivation. The data originated from various University of Missouri programs and special studies, but most notably from the LMVP and the SLAP. The department agrees with and has incorpo- rated into the amendment the suggested formatting and terminology changes provided by HDR to improve the overall clarity of the pro- posed nutrient criteria without changing the intent of the amendment. The department has also included additional clarification in regard to its responsibility to collect sufficient data and information from which to assess response assessment endpoints (i.e., eutrophication impacts). No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
GENERAL WRITTEN COMMENT #2: Support for proposed changes to pH and hardness criteria, mixing zone requirements, and adoption of Multiple Discharger Variance (MDV): Comments received from the AMCA and REGFORM provided general support for the change in the calculation for hardness using the median hard- ness value as well as support for changes to the mixing zone require- ments. The AMCA also supported the adoption of the MDV and pro- posed changes to the pH criteria. Missouri Municipal League also provided general support for the adoption of the MDV. Several com- menters (i.e., the cities of Independence and Springfield, the Little Blue Valley Sewer District, and the Missouri Municipal League) commented in support of those comments provided by the AMCA. RESPONSE: The department appreciates the supportive comments on the proposed revisions to Missouri’s Water Quality Standards. The department agrees that the proposed mixing zone clarifications and adoption of the MDV are in the best interest of Missouri as it allows flexibility in determining appropriate cost-effective measures while maintaining appropriate protections for applicable designated uses in receiving waters. The proposed rule change to the pH criteria was submitted by stakeholders in response to the department’s “Public Notice of Intent to Initiate Triennial Review of Missouri Water Quality Standards.” The department’s research indicates that many states, including those that border Missouri, interpret pH as a chronic rather than an acute condition. The proposed revisions requested by stakeholders will aid in clarifying the intent and protec- tions of the pH criteria and will provide relief to permitted facilities. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
GENERAL WRITTEN COMMENT #3: Associated Industries of Missouri, REGFORM, Missouri Municipal League, Missouri Public Utility Alliance, City of Columbia, National Waste & Recycling Association, and the Doe Run Company all provided comments expressing concern or opposition to the proposed adoption of USEPA’s nationally recommended 304(a) criteria for the protection of human health. Specific concerns included uncertainty pertaining to assumed fish and water consumption rates, acceptable cancer risk incidence rates, the lack of state-specific data and analysis, ongoing USEPA studies, “compounded conservatism,” uncertainty about what waters the criteria apply, and the potential for permit limits that are below existing detection limits.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGES: The depart- ment recognizes the concerns regarding the proposed 304(a) criteria for the protection of human health. Because of these comments, the department is withdrawing the updated 304(a) Human Health Protection uses and associated criteria. This includes both the Organism Only and Organism + Water uses. The department will reevaluate the appropriateness of these criteria in Missouri’s Water Quality Standards during its next triennial review. The existing
Human Health Protection – Fish Consumption use and associated criteria will remain in Missouri’s Water Quality Standards.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENTS:
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #1: REGFORM commented that the existing pH criteria range of 6.5 to 9.0 pH units is overly restrictive and requests that 10 CSR 20-7.031(5)(C) be amended to replace the lower criterion value from 6.5 to 6.0. The commenter states that this less stringent value is used for federal effluent limits and some potable water suppliers.
RESPONSE: The proposed rule change to the pH criteria was sub- mitted by stakeholders in response to the department’s “Public Notice of Intent to Initiate Triennial Review of Missouri Water Quality Standards.” The proposed revisions clarify the duration and frequency of the pH criteria stating that it is to be interpreted as a chronic rather than an acute condition, thereby providing appropriate relief to permitted facilities. Regarding the request to modify the range of the pH criteria, no supporting information was provided for the department to evaluate whether such a change would adequately protect applicable designated uses. In order to maintain adequate and scientifically defensible protection of aquatic life, the department has not altered the existing numerical range at this time. The current pH criteria are consistent with USEPA’s National Recommended Water Quality Criteria for the protection of aquatic life and is based upon USEPA’s “Quality Criteria for Water, 1976” (aka “Red Book”). This document notes that pH levels within the range of 6.5 to 9 “provide adequate protection for the life of freshwater fish and bottom dwelling invertebrate fish food organisms.” Outside of this range, fish “suffer adverse physiological effects increasing in severity as the degree of deviation increases until lethal levels are reached.” The description of pH toxicity in USEPA’s criteria document suggests that values within the pH range are protective against chronic effects, while deviations outside the range may lead to acutely toxic or lethal conditions. While the department is not proposing any changes to the numerical pH range at this time, the department will continue to review, establish, and revise water quality standards as appropriate through the triennial review process. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #2: The City of Blue Springs commented on the removal of site-specific dissolved oxygen criteria for Sni-a-Bar Creek in Table K of 10 CSR 20-7.031. Blue Springs notes that the criteria were established in 2011 and expired on October 31, 2014. Blue Springs references a 2014 comment letter in which the city indicates that available data confirm that the site-spe- cific criteria were protective of aquatic life designated uses. The city requests that the site-specific dissolved oxygen criteria be made per- manent and be considered by the department during this rulemaking or in the department’s next rulemaking effort. The city further states that, if necessary, it will compile and submit additional information to supplement their 2014 comment letter.
RESPONSE: As noted by the commenter, the site-specific dissolved criteria for Sni-a-Bar Creek expired on October 31, 2014. The pro- posed changes to remove expired or disapproved criteria in Table K are to update the rule to reflect current applicable water quality stan- dards. Although the department is not proposing new site-specific criteria for Sni-a-Bar Creek at this time, the department will review any additional data and supportive information the City of Blue Springs provides for consideration in future rulemaking efforts. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #3: Ralph C. Schlemper, Friends of Fox Creek, commented that the criteria in the water qual- ity standards should be stricter and that more pollutants should be included, such as pharmaceuticals. The commenter also stated that stricter permit requirements should be implemented for the Franklin County Public Water Supply District #3 Victoria Gardens Wastewater

  March 15, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 6
  Missouri Register
Page 595
  Treatment Facility, permit number MO-0089656.
RESPONSE: The department adopts water quality criteria that are appropriate for the protection of designated uses based on available USEPA 304(a) nationally recommended criteria or develops criteria using state-specific data. Currently, the USEPA has no nationally rec- ommended water quality criteria for pharmaceuticals, nor is there adequate state-specific data for developing appropriate pharmaceuti- cal water quality criteria. For these reasons, no pharmaceutical water quality criteria are being proposed at this time. The permitting and compliance concerns expressed in the letter will be addressed by the Department’s Water Protection Program’s Permitting and Compliance and Enforcement Section since they do not relate to this rulemaking. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #4: Jeannie Robbins commented that it does not make sense for Truman Lake to have less stringent nutrient criteria than Lake of the Ozarks since Truman Lake feeds into Lake of the Ozarks.
RESPONSE: The proposed numeric nutrient criteria represent the desired condition for a water body that is necessary to protect the applicable designated uses assigned in rule. Because of differences in watershed topography, soils, and geology, nutrient criteria for lakes are determined by the use of four major ecoregions based upon the dominant watershed ecoregion. Using this approach, the dominant watershed ecoregion potentially contributing nutrient loading to Truman Lake is the Plains Ecoregion. Because of the impoundment of Truman Lake, the dominant watershed contributions to Lake of the Ozarks would result from within the Ozark Highlands making that ecoregion’s values the applicable nutrient criteria for Lake of the Ozarks. Although water from Truman Lake does eventually discharge into Lake of the Ozarks, some settling and nutrient attenuation is expected. Additionally, because the criteria are expressed as geomet- ric means, any individual measurements greater than the numeric cri- teria values do not in and of themselves indicate an excursion of water quality standards. Further protection of Lake of the Ozarks will be implemented as a result of added general criteria at 10 CSR 20- 7.031(4)(E), which requires that waters shall maintain a level of water quality at their confluences to downstream waters that provides for attainment and maintenance of the water quality standards of those downstream waters. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #5: The AMCA, the Poultry Federation, and Tyson Foods, Inc. commented that the proposed sul- fate and chloride criteria are not appropriate for Missouri waterbod- ies and may be overprotective. All commenters recommend that hard- ness-based criteria instead be considered. The Poultry Federation also recommends that 10 CSR 20-7.031(5)(L)2. be removed and 10 CSR 20-7.031(5)(L)1. be revised to apply to all waters regardless of flow. Tyson Foods requests that the chloride plus sulfate language in the proposed regulation be tabled.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGES: Proposed sul- fate and chloride rule language at 10 CSR 20-7.031(5)(L) is a rever- sion to rule language in place prior to USEPA’s 2015 disapproval of existing sulfate and chloride criteria. Because of this disapproval, the earlier acute criterion for chloride of eight hundred sixty (860) mg/L and chronic criterion of two hundred thirty (230) mg/L has remained in effect. For this reason, the department is updating the rule to reflect actual effective criteria currently in place and currently being implemented. The department will continue to review, establish, and revise water quality standards as appropriate through the triennial review process.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #6: Lacey Hirschvogel, Missouri Department of Natural Resources, commented that, based on conversations with USEPA, Table J of the rule should be updated to include information for the approved variances for the cities of Fulton and Kirksville.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGES: It is the intent of the department to include information pertaining to approved vari- ances in Table J of 10 CSR 20-7.031 as well as incorporating into the MUDD. For this reason, the information pertaining to the approved variances for the City of Fulton and the City of Kirksville will be added to Table J. These additions do not represent a change in cur- rently effective water quality standards. Although Table J was reserved in the draft amendment revisions available on public com- ment for inclusion of variance information, the rule language itself neglected to reference the table. For this reason, the language includ- ed in 10 CSR 20-7.031(12) will be modified to include a reference to Table J in addition to the MUDD.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #7: USEPA commented that the new numeric criteria Tables A1 and A2 and Tables B1, B2, and B3 should be referenced within the text of the rule, and states that the proposed amendment references these five (5) tables as Table A and Table B in numerous locations.
RESPONSE: The department disagrees with this comment, in that the proposed amendment that was published in the October 16, 2017 Missouri Register correctly included the tables identified by USEPA. No changes were made as a result of this comment. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #8: USEPA commented that los- ing streams are defined in 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(O), which refers to an undated geospatial dataset maintained by the department. USEPA believes it is important to understand that no previously designated or new losing streams in the digital geospatial dataset lose the protec- tions afforded by the bacteria criteria and other more protective restrictions as a result of this change. USEPA asks the department to clarify if these streams will maintain their protective status and appli- cation of the same water quality standards as they are currently applied.
RESPONSE: Changes to 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(O) do not alter how losing stream provisions in rule are currently applied. The MUDD documents the names and locations of rivers, streams, lakes, and reservoirs that have been assigned designated uses. These uses include the presumed “fishable/swimmable” uses assigned under section 101(a)(2) of the federal Clean Water Act and uses already designated in Tables G and H of Missouri’s Water Quality Standards. Information on designated uses and the MUDD can be found at 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(C) and (P), respectively, and their assignment for Clean Water Act purposes at 10 CSR 20-7.031(2). Table J of 10 CSR 20-7.031 contains streams that have been deter- mined to be losing pursuant to the definition and procedures described at 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(N). Losing streams distribute greater than thirty percent (30%) or more of their flow to the subsur- face and constitute a hydrologic and geologic characteristic of the stream. The losing stream determination does not characterize or assess habitat or any other use of the water body, just its hydrologic nature. Table J has historically been used to keep an updated list of losing streams in the state. However, the table is static, out of date, and not integrated into department online electronic applications or online services. The current Table J has a total of two thousand three hundred eighty-one (2,381) miles of streams determined to be losing, which is far less than currently found in the geospatial dataset (five thousand two hundred seventy-seven (5,277) miles). The change in reference from Table J to a geospatial dataset will allow the public and end users the ability to have the most up-to-date information on losing streams in the state. There is no one-to-one relationship between the MUDD and Table J because they are separate datasets with separate applications. However, there is spatial overlap in the data sets since both use the 1:24,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset flow-line work for geo-referencing. The current losing stream geospatial dataset has seven thousand three hundred five (7,305) losing stream segments that total five thousand two hundred seventy-seven (5,277) miles. Of these segments, four thousand seven

 Orders of Rulemaking
  hundred sixty-six (4,766) segments totaling four thousand fifty-one (4,051) miles have a corresponding water body with the same spatial extent in the MUDD. There is overlap between the two (2) datasets for four thousand fifty-one (4,051) miles where a stream is both los- ing and has aquatic habitat protection. The remainder of the losing stream dataset has two thousand five hundred thirty-nine (2,539) seg- ments with a length of one thousand two hundred twenty-six (1,226) stream miles that are not assigned designated uses, but continue to receive general narrative criteria protection. As found at 10 CSR 20- 7.031(4), general narrative criteria protections apply to all waters of the state at all times, including mixing zones. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #9: USEPA commented on the revised language for the definition of Ozark Stream found at 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(V) of the proposed amendment. USEPA states that it is unclear from the proposed amendment or supporting documentation what, if any, differences exist between the 1989 version and subse- quent amendments or additions which are affirmatively excluded per the revised language. USEPA asks for clarification as to why this change was necessary and what effect is realized through the revised definition.
RESPONSE: The department revised this definition to maintain con- sistency in the manner in which documents are referenced throughout the rule. This modification does not change the document referenced nor does it result in any changes in how water quality standards are implemented. No changes were made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #10: USEPA commented on the revised definition for “waters of the state” as found at 10 CSR 20- 7.031(1)(EE) of the proposed amendment. USEPA notes the revision makes the definition consistent with state statute at section 644.016, RSMo. USEPA asks the department to provide clarification that the definition does not limit the application of Clean Water Act protec- tions to waters of the United States and waters of the state that may be entirely located on private property.
RESPONSE: The definition of waters of the state was revised in order to remain consistent with section 644.016, RSMo. This revi- sion does not affect the applicability or implementation of the rule from current policies and procedures. Specific criteria at 10 CSR 20- 7.031(5) remain applicable to waters contained in Tables G and H and the MUDD. General narrative criteria at 10 CSR 20-7.031(4) remain applicable to all waters of the state at all times including mix- ing zones. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #11: USEPA commented that the revised general criterion for mixing zones at 10 CSR 20- 7.031(4)(D) of the proposed amendment explicitly allows acute tox- icity to occur in zones of initial dilution and chronic toxicity to occur in mixing zones. USEPA notes that a mixing zone is an allocated impact zone where water quality criteria can be exceeded as long as acutely toxic conditions are prevented. USEPA recommends remov- ing the revision explicitly allowing acute toxicity to occur in zones of initial dilution. USEPA also recommends that multiple discharges in the same stream should be located on the same side of the stream to support a zone of passage. USEPA recommends the mixing zone lan- guage should specifically address the need for a zone of passage.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department has revised 10 CSR 20-7.031(4)(D) to remove the allowance of acute toxicity in zones of initial dilution, but clarify that excursions of “acute toxicity criteria” may be allowed by permit in these areas. The language is now consistent with definitions of “mixing zone” and “zones of initial dilution” at 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(R) and (HH), respectively. Missouri’s Water Quality Standards define “zone of passage” at 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(II) and the mixing zone subsection, 10 CSR 20-7.031(5)(A)4.E. requires that zones of passage be provid- ed.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #12: USEPA commented that revisions to the pH criteria at 10 CSR 20-7.031(5) of the proposed amendment change the application of this criteria from an acute (instantaneous) value to a chronic value (four- (4-) day average). USEPA states that the department should clarify why this change is scientifically defensible and protective of the use in order to support approval.
RESPONSE: In order to maintain adequate and scientifically defen- sible protection of aquatic life, the department has not altered the existing numerical range. Application of the criteria as chronic values is consistent with USEPA’s National Recommended Water Quality Criteria for the protection of aquatic life and is based upon USEPA’s “Quality Criteria for Water, 1976” (aka “Red Book”). This docu- ment notes that pH levels within the range of 6.5 to 9 “provide ade- quate protection for the life of freshwater fish and bottom dwelling invertebrate fish food organisms.” Outside of this range, fish “suffer adverse physiological effects increasing in severity as the degree of deviation increases until lethal levels are reached.” The description of pH toxicity in USEPA’s criteria document suggests that values within the pH range are protective against chronic effects. Likewise, USEPA’s National Recommended Aquatic Life Criteria table avail- able online at USEPA’s website also identifies pH as a chronic pollu- tant for fresh water, citing the same range as that provided in Missouri’s Water Quality Standards. 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(E) pro- vides that chronic numeric criteria (with the exception of total ammo- nia nitrogen) should be considered four- (4-) day averages. For water quality assessment purposes, the department will continue to deter- mine impairment based on pH criteria when no more than ten per- cent (10%) of all grab samples exceeding the water quality criteria. When continuous data is available, the department will evaluate com- pliance with pH criteria as a four- (4-) day average with no more than one (1) exceedance per year. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #13: USEPA commented that the MDV is inconsistent with 40 CFR section 131.14 without the identification of waterbodies to which the water quality standards variance applies. USEPA comments that a March 1, 2017 draft of the MDV framework included a list of water body segments where the MDV could potentially be utilized and noted its removal in the September 15, 2017 MDV document. USEPA also suggests that the MDV document proposed for adoption through reference in 10 CSR 20-7.031(12)(B) of the proposed amendment was made available for comment on November 20, 2017. USEPA states that this is inconsis- tent with 40 CFR section 25.5(b), which requires documents relevant to the discussion at a public hearing to be made available at least thir- ty (30) days prior to the hearing.
RESPONSE: The list of water body segments where the MDV could potentially be utilized was removed from MDV Framework as it caused confusion among stakeholders and did not add value to the framework. Furthermore, the USEPA’s Water Quality Standards (WQS) Variance Building Tool Flow Chart specifically states, “in circumstances where the state or authorized tribe cannot identify the applicable discharger(s) at the time the WQS variance is adopted, the state or authorized tribe may establish requirements that identify those dischargers in the future. Identify the specific requirements that each discharger must meet to be eligible for coverage under the desired WQS variance and the potential universe of receiving waters.” The MDV Framework provides the requirements to identify which dischargers would qualify in the future and the potential uni- verse of receiving waters by stating, “3. Qualifying Dischargers: The potential applicants for the MDV includes minor municipal, Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW), multi-celled facultative lagoon systems where the residents of the community would experience a substantial and widespread social and economic impact if required to comply with the WQS used to derive the water quality based effluent limit (WQBEL) for total ammonia nitrogen. To qualify for this vari- ance, the applicant’s lagoon system must meet the standards of a

  March 15, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 6
  Missouri Register
Page 597
  well-functioning lagoon system....the requirements of well-function- ing lagoon systems are found in Appendix A.” whereas, Appendix A states that, “This [well-functioning lagoon] determination is not intended to address facilities that discharge to waters where waste- load allocations exist for total ammonia nitrogen.” Therefore, it is clear that the MDV Framework will be applicable to all waters of the state except where a wasteload allocation exists for total ammonia nitrogen. Furthermore, additional transparency as to which water- bodies are affected by the MDV when the permitted discharger has qualified for a variance from the water quality standards of total ammonia nitrogen and the permit is public noticed for thirty (30) days per 10 CSR 20-6.020 and available for public viewing online at dnr.mo.gov/env/wpp/permits/pn/index.html. After permits are issued under the terms and conditions of this MDV Framework; the municipality name, facility name, Missouri State Operating Permit number, receiving stream name, first classified water body identifi- cation (WBID) number, 8-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC 8), dis- charge location in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordi- nates, permit effective date, numeric highest attainable effluent con- ditions, and variance expiration date for each recipient of the variance will be tracked in a table found on the department’s website at: dnr.mo.gov/env/wpp/permits/wqs-variances.htm.
The department disagrees that the MDV only became publicly available on November 20, 2017. The MDV was identified in the October 16, 2017 Missouri Register and has been publicly available in its final form to anyone since that date. It has also been the focus of two (2) public notices and comment periods. The first public notice period was a thirty- (30-) day period starting on May 6 through June 6, 2016. The second public notice was a thirty- (30-) day period starting on March 1 through March 30, 2017. The comments and comment response letters from the second public notice can be found online at dnr.mo.gov/env/wpp/permits/wqs-variances.htm. Further, this MDV Framework has gone through the formal stakeholder engagement process as it has been a standing item on the agenda dur- ing the Missouri Clean Water Forum. The department incorporated comments received from stakeholders into the MDV Framework where necessary prior to finalizing the document on September 15, 2017. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #14: USEPA commented that Table A1 lists human health protection criterion values for Benzo-a- Pyrene as being based on carcinogenicity risk of 10-5. USEPA states that these values need to be corrected to be based on a carcinogenic- ity risk of 10-6 to be consistent with the rule.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGES: Because of con- cerns expressed through stakeholder comments, the department is withdrawing the updated 304(a) Human Health Protection uses and associated criteria. This includes both the Organism Only and Organism + Water uses. Department will reevaluate the appropriate- ness of these criteria in Missouri’s Water Quality Standards during its next triennial review. The existing Human Health Protection – Fish Consumption use and associated criteria will remain in Missouri’s Water Quality Standards.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #15: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service commented that the department should consider how changes to mixing zone requirements, pH criteria, and the MDV Framework might affect various federally listed endangered species. In a similar comment, the Great Rivers Environmental Law Center commented that the proposed amendment fails to establish updated water quality criteria for ammonia and results in violation of the Endangered Species Act.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGES: Proposed water quality criteria are established at levels that protect applicable desig- nated uses including the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish and wildlife. Proposed changes to the Water Quality Standards rule for pH and mixing zones provide clarification and additional flexibility, but do not reduce protections of the underlying designated use. The
department will continue to review, establish, and revise water qual- ity standards as appropriate through the triennial review process. The department is not adopting USEPA national recommended 304(a) cri- teria for ammonia in this rule making, but will continue to review the appropriateness of existing water quality standards and intends to establish and revise water quality standards as appropriate through a future triennial review.
For facilities applying for variances from existing water quality standards under the MDV, site-specific considerations will be made to ensure protections of the highest attainable effluent condition in accordance with federal regulations at 40 CFR section 131.3(o). Additionally, it is the department’s practice to require all variance applicants to provide results from the Natural Heritage Review Report. The permit holder will submit a query to the Missouri Department of Conservation requesting information about species and natural communities of conservation concern at the point of discharge. The results will indicate whether federally-or state-list- ed threatened or endangered species, including those proposed for such listing, or critical habitat, designated or proposed, are located at the point of discharge. If results indicate that a federally- or state- listed threatened or endangered species or their critical habitat are currently at or near the point of discharge, the applicant is to provide the list of the threatened or endangered species or their habitats, including those proposed for listing, and the justification as to why the issuance of this variance does not jeopardize their continued exis- tence or the existence of their habitat. It is not anticipated that the granting of variances to qualifying applicants will jeopardize threat- ened or endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of such species’ critical habitat.
Specifically regarding ammonia criteria, the department is defer- ring water quality criteria updates for this as well as aluminum, cad- mium, manganese, and bacteria/pathogens to a future rulemaking following stakeholder group discussion. Existing USEPA-approved ammonia criteria at 10 CSR 20-7.031(5)(B)7. for the protection of designated recreational uses remain effective.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #16: The Great Rivers Environmental Law Center commented that the Missouri Antidegradation Rule and Implementation Procedure (AIP), fails to address concerns raised by USEPA during the last triennial review, which resulted in the 2015 disapproval of 10 CSR 20-7.031(3)(D). RESPONSE: The proposed amendment adopts the revised AIP approved by the commission on July 13, 2016. These revisions to the AIP were made in response to USEPA’s notification that the de min- imis provision in Missouri’s AIP made no distinction between bioac- cumulative versus non-bioaccumulative pollutants. Adoption and ref- erence to an approved AIP addresses USEPA’s concerns. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #17: The Great Rivers Environmental Law Center commented that 10 CSR 20-7.031(12) fails to remove references to sections 644.061 and 644.062, RSMo, in violation of 40 CFR section 130.10(g).
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The language, “A variance from water quality standards shall comply with 40 CFR 131.14.” was added to 10 CSR 20-7.031(12) to distinguish between state variances covered under state statute and variances from water quality standards which must meet the requirements of 40 CFR 131.14.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #18: The Great Rivers Environmental Law Center commented that the proposed amendment fails to designate uses and establish criteria for wetlands. RESPONSE: Although no specific wetland criteria or designated uses are being proposed at this time, all waters of the state are pro- tected by the general narrative criteria at 10 CSR 20-7.031(4). The department will, through a stakeholder process, continue to discuss the application of designated uses to wetlands and will propose such

 Orders of Rulemaking
  uses and appropriate criteria in a future triennial review. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #19: The Great Rivers Environmental Law Center commented that the proposed amendment fails to establish criteria for waters designated with the ephemeral aquatic habitat use.
RESPONSE: There are no waters in Missouri designated for ephemeral aquatic habitat use and the department is not proposing criteria for the protection of this use at this time. All waters of the state are protected by the general narrative criteria at 10 CSR 20- 7.031(4) and the specific criteria at 10 CSR 20-7.031(5) remain applicable to waters contained in Tables G and H and the MUDD. The department will continue to review the appropriateness of exist- ing water quality standards, and establish and revise water quality standards as appropriate through a future triennial review. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #20: The Great Rivers Environmental Law Center commented that the proposed amendment fails to update bacteria criteria.
RESPONSE: Water quality criteria updates for aluminum, cadmium, manganese, ammonia, and bacteria/pathogens will be deferred to a future rulemaking following stakeholder group discussion. Existing USEPA-approved bacteria criteria at 10 CSR 20-7.031(5)(C) for the protection of designated recreational uses remain effective. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #21: The Great Rivers Environmental Law Center commented that the adoption of 10 CSR 20-7.031(4)(E) will help protect Missouri’s waterways. RESPONSE: The department appreciates the Great Rivers Environmental Law Center’s support for the added provision to pro- tect downstream water quality as a general criteria at 10 CSR 20- 7.031(4)(E). No changes have been made as a result of this com- ment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #22: The Great Rivers Environmental Law Center commented that the adoption of various 304(a) National Recommended Criteria, especially human health cri- teria, will help protect Missouri’s water recreationists.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGES: The depart- ment appreciates the Great Rivers Environmental Law Center’s sup- port for the proposed 304(a) criteria for the protection of human health. Because of numerous comments received expressing concern about the proposed criteria, the department is withdrawing the updat- ed 304(a) Human Health Protection uses and associated criteria. This includes both the Organism Only and Organism + Water uses. The department will reevaluate the appropriateness of these criteria in Missouri’s Water Quality Standards during its next triennial review. The existing Human Health Protection – Fish Consumption use and associated criteria will remain in Missouri’s Water Quality Standards.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #23: The AMCA commented on the need for a clerical correction to 10 CSR 20-7.031(5)(S)1.B. to correct the reference to the definition of water effect ratio. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department appreciates the AMCA for pointing out this error. The reference at 10 CSR 20-7.031(5)(S)1.B. to the water effect ratio definition has been corrected.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #24: The AMCA commented that while it supports the proposed numeric nutrient criteria, screen- ing thresholds should not be converted to water quality standards for Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) purposes. The Association stated that a more appropriate approach for these circumstances would be to trigger development of site-specific criteria and then
base a TMDL on those criteria. The Association urged the depart- ment to clarify this in either this rulemaking or the next update to this regulation.
RESPONSE: The TMDL language at 10 CSR 20- 7.031(5)(N)1.C.(I)(b) of the proposed amendment has been removed. As a result, the rule does not contemplate that Table M screening values will necessarily serve as water quality standards for TMDL purposes. TMDLs must be established at levels necessary to attain and maintain all applicable water quality criteria and protect the uses. This includes the Table L criteria and the Table M threshold values plus eutrophication factors. The department will establish load allocations and wasteload allocations to meet the criteria and protect uses on a watershed-specific basis for each impaired water body. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #25: The AMCA commented that the formulas for hardness dependent metals criteria in Table A2 of the proposed amendment should be modified to include the water effect ratio. The AMCA clarifies that the water effect ratio should be assigned a value of one (1) unless the department approves a water effect ratio study that yields a different value.
RESPONSE: No changes to hardness based metals criteria to include a default water effect ratio factor are being proposed at this time. Site-specific considerations will be made individually for each water effects ratio study for use in developing appropriate permit effluent limits. The department will review the appropriateness of the requested change during the next triennial review. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #26: The Missouri Corn Growers Association and Missouri Soybean Association jointly com- mented that their position remains that more effective alternatives exist to numeric nutrient criteria and recognize that the department is moving forward in response to a 2016 federal consent decree. These associations also expressed concern that the proposed numeric nutrient criteria may result in perpetual water quality impairments of northern Missouri lakes and that these concerns should be addressed by the department during implementation by affording maximum flexibility in any assessment and restoration process.
RESPONSE: The department agrees that it is in the state’s best inter- est to adopt this amendment to avoid promulgation at the federal level. The department will complete water quality assessments in accordance with established listing methodologies on a biennial basis as part of its Clean Water Act sections 305(b) and 303(d) reporting efforts. Both future listing methodology documents and 303(d) lists of impaired waters will be developed with input from stakeholders and the interested public. Restoration efforts will primarily be com- pleted through an adaptive implementation approach that makes progress toward achieving water quality goals while using new data and information to adjust implementation activities. The department will, through the triennial review process, continue to evaluate the appropriateness of existing water quality standards and may consider site-specific criteria based on a sound scientific rationale that protect designated uses as provided in 40 CFR 131.11(b)(1)(ii). No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #27: Missouri Agribusiness Association (MO-AG) commented that although not all concerns have been alleviated, but MO-AG does not oppose the proposed numeric nutrient criteria. MO-AG commented that the most concern- ing item is the proposed chlorophyll-a criterion of 30 μg/L and the screening value of 18 μg/L for Missouri lakes in the plains ecore- gion. MO-AG commented that these lakes are managed for sport fish and the proposed criteria are overly protective.
RESPONSE: Proposed numeric water quality criteria for nutrients are protective of applicable designated aquatic life uses as required in 40 CFR section 131.11. Missouri does not currently have a spe- cific sport fish designated use and the applicable aquatic life use is

  protective of all aquatic species. The habitats of the species across Missouri lakes vary greatly. The numeric criteria will protect sport fish, their respective prey, and sensitive species that may exist in the lake ecosystem. The 30 μg/L criterion and 18 μg/L threshold values for chlorophyll-a are appropriately protective of lakes in the Plains ecoregion in Missouri and have been outlined in the supporting doc- umentation and rationale. Using sport fishery status as an indicator of aquatic life use protection is ecologically justified because sport fish are generally apex predators in reservoir systems. The depart- ment’s findings show that the health of sport fish populations can be interpreted as an indicator of overall ecosystem health and the pres- ence of a wide variety of aquatic biota, which is consistent with 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(C)1.A. and 40 CFR 131.11(a). No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #28: Missouri Coalition for the Environment, Missouri Farmers Union, Great Rivers Environmental Law Center, Missouri Sierra Club, Great Rivers Habitat Alliance, Bridging the Gap, and St. Louis Audubon provided joint comments on the proposed numeric nutrient criteria. These groups commented that the criteria do not include specific values for the protection of drinking water supply or recreational uses. These groups also com- ment that the chlorophyll-a and nutrient screening values approach does not constitute numeric nutrient criteria.
RESPONSE: The department revised the draft amendment to remove the drinking water supply use criteria. Stakeholders had requested the department reevaluate the necessity of those criteria given the pro- posed aquatic life use criteria also would be protective of the drinking water supply use. Stakeholders had also raised concerns that the pro- posed raw drinking water source criteria were developed using a potentially overly conservative approach based on finished drinking water levels. The department notes that the criteria derived for the protection of aquatic life uses in lakes located within the Ozark Highlands and Ozark Border ecoregions are more protective than the proposed drinking water supply use criteria and is therefore protec- tive of both designated uses. For lakes in the Plains ecoregion, the difference in the chlorophyll-a criterion proposed for aquatic life pro- tections, 30 μg/L, and the criterion proposed for drinking water sup- ply protections, 25 μg/L, is 5 μg/L. Recognizing that the drinking water supply use as defined in 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(C)6. applies to raw water which will yield potable water after treatment by public water treatment facilities (emphasis added), the department deter- mined that the 5 μg/L difference will not significantly affect the abil- ity of drinking water treatment operations to provide drinking water that meets Safe Drinking Water standards. As noted in research cited with the proposed rule, microcystins were not detected in Missouri reservoirs eighty percent (80%) of the time (one thousand three hun- dred thirty-one (1,331) non-detects out of one thousand six hundred fifty-eight (1,658) samples); where detected, they generally were found at low levels. Microcystin concentrations in raw water greater than 0.3 μg/L (n = 140), the USEPA health advisory level for bot- tle-fed infants and young children for finished drinking water, occurred in less than ten percent (10%) of the samples with a median chlorophyll-a concentration of 33.5 μg/L. The 30-μg/L chlorophyll- a criterion proposed for aquatic life in the Plains ecoregion, which would apply to raw drinking water sources, ensures the probability of microcystin occurrence for finished water is less than ten percent (10%). Therefore, the aquatic life criterion adequately protects drinking water sources from impairment with respect to the algal toxin microcystin. Data continues to be gathered on algal toxins in Missouri lakes, with a second toxin (cylindrospermopsin) being mon- itored in addition to microcystin during the 2017 summer season. The department is in discussions with the University of Missouri Limnology Laboratory to also add saxitoxin and anatoxin-a analyses to the lake monitoring programs. These additional data will help clar- ify the extent of algal toxins in Missouri’s lakes. The department also continues to grow its understanding of both the factors that drive toxin production and the efficiencies of treatment in removing algal
toxins from source water. These efforts will enable the state to better address drinking water protection during a future rulemaking.
Research and information continue to develop at the national level with respect to nutrient impacts and criteria for the protection of recreational uses. Missouri intends to pursue numeric nutrient crite- ria for recreational designated uses during a future rulemaking. This effort will allow studies currently underway by USEPA and others on the effects of cyanotoxins on recreational uses to mature, and for the state to conduct user perception surveys of algae by the recreating public. Although specific criteria for the protection of recreational uses are not specified, the inclusion of both causal and response threshold values provides additional water quality protections.
The inclusion of screening values as well as eutrophication factors provides a weight-of-evidence approach to understand nutrient response conditions and how they impair designated uses. The screening values are intended to supplement chlorophyll criteria and provide additional protections to Missouri lakes. Screening values provide a quantitative metric for flagging lakes in need of additional evaluation. Lake impairments that might otherwise go unnoticed are more likely to be identified and corrective measures can be taken ear- lier. This process also reduces the likelihood of false positive impair- ment decisions that would direct Missouri’s limited resources away from restoration priorities. Additionally, screen values are set at lev- els considerably lower than the criteria identified as protective of aquatic life. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #29: Washington University School of Law Interdisciplinary Environmental Clinic commented on the numeric nutrient criteria for lakes. The commenter noted that the criteria do not include specific values for the protection of drinking water supply or recreational uses. The commenter also stated that the proposed criteria do not provide adequate protection of aquatic life and they oppose the use of a screening-value approach. The com- menter expresses concern regarding the implementation of the nutri- ent criteria in permits. Also concern is expressed regarding the inclu- sion and use of the five (5) eutrophication factors contained in the nutrient criteria. As a supplement to their comments Washington University provided additional assessment and recommendations of the proposed amendment from JoAnn Burkholder, Ph.D. RESPONSE: The department revised the draft amendment to remove the drinking water supply use criteria. Stakeholders had requested the department reevaluate the necessity of those criteria given the pro- posed aquatic life use criteria also would be protective of the drinking water supply use. As a result of this change the RIR was modified and made available for a second public comment period. Public notice was made noting the public of the change and available docu- mentation was provided on the department’s website for public review and comment. As a result of this change, the department noted that the criteria derived for the protection of aquatic life uses in lakes located within the Ozark Highlands and Ozark Border ecore- gions are more protective than the proposed drinking water supply use criteria and is therefore protective of both designated uses. For lakes in the Plains ecoregion, the difference in the chlorophyll-a cri- terion proposed for aquatic life protections, 30 μg/L, and the criteri- on proposed for drinking water supply protections, 25 μg/L, is 5 μg/L. Recognizing that the drinking water supply use as defined in 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(C)6. applies to raw water which will yield potable water after treatment by public water treatment facilities (emphasis added), the department determined that the 5 μg/L differ- ence will not significantly affect the ability of drinking water treat- ment operations to provide drinking water that meets Safe Drinking Water standards. Data continues to be gathered on algal toxins in Missouri lakes, with a second toxin (cylindrospermopsin) being mon- itored in addition to microcystin during the 2017 summer season. The department is in discussions with the University of Missouri Limnology Laboratory to also add saxitoxin and anatoxin-a analyses to the lake monitoring programs. These additional data will help clar- ify the extent of algal toxins in Missouri’s lakes. The department also

  continues to grow its understanding of both the factors that drive toxin production and the efficiencies of treatment in removing algal toxins from source water. These efforts will enable the state to better address drinking water protection during a future rulemaking.
Research and information continue to develop at the national level with respect to nutrient impacts and criteria for the protection of recreational uses. Missouri intends to pursue numeric nutrient crite- ria for recreational designated uses during a future rulemaking. This effort will allow studies currently underway by USEPA and others on the effects of cyanotoxins on recreational uses to mature, and for the state to conduct user perception surveys of algae by the recreating public. Although specific criteria for the protection of recreational uses are not specified, the inclusion of both causal and response threshold values provides additional water quality protections.
Regarding protections for aquatic life, numeric nutrient criteria were derived based on trophic status ranges by ecoregion. The rich- est species diversity index from each ecoregion was used as the target for the trophic status based on a corresponding range of chlorophyll- a. The criteria were derived by finding the level of algal growth that promotes sustainable biotic diversity by being neither a limiting fac- tor from its scarcity nor a limiting factor from its obstructive pres- ence in large quantities. The screening values are intended to supple- ment chlorophyll criteria and provide additional protections to Missouri lakes. Screening values provide a quantitative metric for flagging lakes in need of additional evaluation. Lake impairments that might otherwise go unnoticed are more likely to be identified and corrective measures can be taken earlier. This process also reduces the likelihood of false positive impairment decisions that would direct Missouri’s limited resources away from restoration pri- orities. Additionally, screening values are set at levels considerably lower than the criteria identified as protective of aquatic life.
The nutrient criteria framework will be implemented through state operating permits where reasonable potential to cause or contribute to downstream excursions of applicable water quality standards exists. Wasteload allocation and effluent-limit derivation will follow established state and federal guidance for deriving nutrient effluent limits to ensure downstream water quality standards are attained. Furthermore, the proposed amendment states that where site-specific targets are lacking for impaired waters, nutrient screening thresholds will be used for TMDL development. Implementation of nutrient effluent limitations and TMDL wasteload allocations may drive upgrades in wastewater treatment.
The use of the five (5) eutrophication factors provides a weight-of- evidence approach that uses nutrient response conditions that can impair designated uses with nutrient screening thresholds. The department’s proposal reflects the understanding that a narrative standard to support a factor in nutrient impairment that may not be covered by the criterion and threshold values currently proposed. Proving the fish were killed by nutrient impacts will be documented by the monitoring and assessment of physical and chemical parame- ters at the site and compared to information provided in the Missouri Department of Conservation’s fish kill database. No definition of excursion criteria is required, because the rule language references the specific criteria for both pH and dissolved oxygen. These criteria can be found in 10 CSR 20-7.031(5)(E) and 10 CSR 20-7.031(5)(J) respectively. In addition, exceedance rates from water quality stan- dards that result in impairment are presented in the Department’s Listing Methodology Document. Because water quality assessments are completed on a biennial basis as part of its Clean Water Act sec- tions 305(b) and 303(d) reporting efforts, the listing methodology document is the appropriate location for such references. In contrast with the assertion that cells per volume in relation to cyanotoxins were derived from a USEPA document for acute human health crite- ria, the department instead derived its cell count values as outlined in the “Rationale for Missouri Numeric Nutrient Criteria for Lakes, Nov. 21, 2016” on page 44, which was made available online with other reference documents. The use of mineral turbidity as an eutrophication factor is appropriate as it has been documented that
mineral turbidity can have a negative effect on algal production, thereby inhibiting chlorophyll-a production that, if looked at alone, would obscure a water quality impairment. Although the use of a Secchi disk is one approach for measuring turbidity, the department will continue to evaluate other approaches as well for possible rela- tionships between total suspended solids and chlorophyll-a produc- tion when developing future listing methodology documents. Future listing methodology documents to implement the numeric nutrient criteria for assessment purposes will be developed with input from stakeholders and the interested public.
The department appreciates the supplemental information and rec- ommendations provided by Washington University from Dr. Burkholder. The department will carefully consider the applicability of these recommendations to Missouri’s Water Quality Standards as part of future triennial review efforts. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
SPECIFIC WRITTEN COMMENT #30: Robert Angelo commented on the proposed numeric nutrient criteria for lakes. Angelo com- mented that the department has altered its scope on the overall pro- tectiveness of its rulemaking effort by eliminating drinking water supply protections and by increasing the Plains ecoregion chloro- phyll-a criterion from 30 μg/L to 40 μg/L. Angelo commented that such changes are not addressed by the department in its rationale document. Angelo also provided a supplemental technical analysis of the proposed numeric nutrient criteria with the supplied comments. RESPONSE: The department revised the draft amendment to remove the drinking water supply use criteria. Stakeholders had requested the department reevaluate the necessity of those criteria given the proposed aquatic life use criteria also would be protective of the drinking water supply use. Stakeholders had also raised concerns that the proposed raw drinking water source criteria were developed using a potentially overly conservative approach based on finished drinking water levels. The department notes that the criteria derived for the protection of aquatic life uses in lakes located within the Ozark Highlands and Ozark Border ecoregions are more protective than the proposed drinking water supply use criteria and therefore is protec- tive of both designated uses. For lakes in the Plains ecoregion, the difference in the chlorophyll-a criterion proposed for aquatic life pro- tections, 30 μg/L, and the criteria proposed for drinking water supply protections, 25 μg/L, is minimal and is expected to provide adequate protection from impairment. The department has not increased its pro- posed chlorophyll-a criterion for the Plains ecoregion and is maintain- ing the 30 μg/L criterion value for the protection of aquatic life. It should be noted that the drinking water supply use as defined in 10 CSR 20-7.031(1)(C)6. applies to raw water which will yield potable water after treatment by public water treatment facilities. Finished drinking water standards are the purview of the Safe Drinking Water Act and are outside the scope of this rulemaking. As noted in research cited with the proposed amendment, microcystins were not detected in Missouri reservoirs eighty percent (80%) of the time (one thousand three hundred thirty-one (1,331) non-detects out of one thousand six hundred fifty-eight (1,658) samples); where detected, they generally were found at low levels. Microcystin concentrations in raw water greater than 0.3 μg/L (n = 140), the USEPA health advisory level for bottle-fed infants and young children for finished drinking water, occurred in less than ten percent (10%) of the samples with a median chlorophyll-a concentration of 33.5 μg/L. The 30-μg/L chlorophyll-a criterion proposed for aquatic life in the Plains ecoregion, which would apply to raw drinking water sources, ensures the probability of microcystin occurrence for finished water is less than ten percent (10%). Therefore, the aquatic life criterion adequately protects drink- ing water sources from impairment with respect to the algal toxin microcystin. Data continues to be gathered on algal toxins in Missouri lakes, with a second toxin (cylindrospermopsin) being monitored in addition to microcystin during the 2017 summer season. The depart- ment is in discussions with the University of Missouri Limnology Laboratory to also add saxitoxin and anatoxin-a analyses to the lake

  monitoring programs. These additional data will help clarify the extent of algal toxins in Missouri’s lakes. The department also con- tinues to grow its understanding of both the factors that drive toxin production and the efficiencies of treatment in removing algal toxins from source water. These efforts will enable the state to better address drinking water protection during a future rulemaking.
Additional information pertaining to the specific scientific and technical approach used in development of Missouri’s numeric nutri- ent criteria will be provided in a supplemental rationale document. This rationale document will be incorporated in the state’s overall water quality standards submittal package to USEPA for approval. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
EDITORIAL CHANGES
EDITORIAL CHANGE #1: The draft amendment available for pub- lic comment period contained an error in which the drinking water supply use criterion of 250 mg/L (250,000 μg/L) for sulfate and chloride was mistakenly placed in the column for the human health protection use.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: This error has been corrected in the final version of the rule, but does not reflect a change from current effective water quality standards.
10 CSR 20-7.031 Water Quality Standards
(4) General Criteria. The following water quality criteria shall be applicable to all waters of the state at all times including mixing zones. No water contaminant, by itself or in combination with other substances, shall prevent the waters of the state from meeting the fol- lowing conditions:
(D) Waters shall be free from substances or conditions in sufficient amounts to result in toxicity to human, animal, or aquatic life. However, acute toxicity criteria may be exceeded by permit in zones of initial dilution, and chronic toxicity criteria may be exceeded by permit in mixing zones;
(5) Specific Criteria. The specific criteria shall apply to waters con- tained in Tables G and H of this rule and the Missouri Use Designation Dataset. Protection of drinking water supply is limited to surface waters designated for raw drinking water supply and aquifers. Protection of whole body contact recreation is limited to waters designated for that use.
(M) Carcinogenic Substances. Carcinogenic substances shall not exceed concentrations in water which correspond to the 10-6 cancer risk rate. This risk rate equates to one (1) additional cancer case in a population of one (1) million with lifetime exposure. Derivation of this concentration assumes average water and fish consumption amounts. Assumptions are two (2) liters of water and six and one-half (6.5) grams of fish consumed per day. Federally established final maximum contaminant levels for drinking water supply shall super- sede drinking water supply criteria developed in this manner.
(N) Nutrients and Chlorophyll. 1. Definitions.
A. For the purposes of these criteria, all lakes and reservoirs shall be referred to as “lakes.”
B. Lake ecoregions—Due to differences in watershed topog- raphy, soils, and geology, nutrient criteria for lakes and reservoirs will be determined by the use of four (4) major ecoregions based upon dominant watershed ecoregion. These regions were delineated by grouping the ecological subsections described in Nigh and Schroeder, 2002, Atlas of Missouri Ecoregions, as follows:
(I) Plains: OP1 – Scarped Osage Plains; OP2 – Cherokee Plains; TP2—Deep Loess Hills; TP3—Loess Hills; TP4— Grand River Hills; TP5—Chariton River Hills; TP6—Claypan Till Plains; TP7—Wyaconda River Dissected Till Plains; TP8— Mississippi River Hills;
(II) Ozark Border: MB2a—Crowley’s Ridge Loess Woodland/Forest Hills; OZ11—Prairie Ozark Border; OZ12— Outer
Ozark Border; OZ13—Inner Ozark Border;
(III) Ozark Highland: OZ1—Springfield Plain; OZ2—
Springfield Plateau; OZ3—Elk River Hills; OZ4—White River Hills; OZ5—Central Plateau; OZ6—Osage River Hills; OZ7—Gasconade River Hills; OZ8—Meramec River Hills; OZ9—Current River Hills; OZ10—St. Francois Knobs and Basins; OZ14—Black River Ozark Border; and
(IV) Big River Floodplain: MB1—Black River Alluvial Plain; MB2b—Crowley’s Ridge Footslopes and Alluvial Plains; MB3—St. Francis River Alluvial Plain; MB4, OZ16, TP9— Mississippi River Alluvial Plain; OZ15, TP1—Missouri River Alluvial Plain.
C. Nutrient Criteria—Nutrient criteria represent the desired condition for a water body necessary to protect the designated uses assigned in rule.
(I) Lake Ecoregion Criteria—A decision framework that integrates causal and response parameters into one water quality stan- dard that accounts for uncertainty in linkages between causal and response parameters.
(a) Response Impairment Thresholds—Maximum ambi- ent concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) that are based on annual geometric means of samples collected May through September with an allowable exceedance frequency of one in three (1-in-3) years for lakes that have not been assigned site-specific criteria.
(b) Nutrient Screening Thresholds—Maximum ambient concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and Chl-a that are based on the annual geometric mean of samples col- lected May through September. Nutrient screening thresholds repre- sent causal and response parameter concentrations, above which an exceedance in any one year warrants further evaluation of Response Assessment Endpoints.
(c) Response Assessment Endpoints—Narrative and numeric biological response endpoints that link directly to designated use impairment.
(II) Lake Site-Specific Criteria—Maximum Ambient Concentrations of TP, TN, or Chl-a that are based on the geometric mean of a minimum of three (3) years of data and the characteristics of the waterbody.
2. This rule applies to all lakes that are waters of the state and have an area of at least ten (10) acres during normal pool condition. Big River Floodplain lakes shall not be subject to these criteria.
3. Response Impairment Thresholds are listed in Table L. Nutrient Screening Thresholds are listed in Table M. Lake Site- Specific Criteria for TP, TN, and Chl-a are listed in Table N. Additional lake site-specific criteria may be developed in accordance with subsection (5)(S) to account for the unique characteristics of the waterbody that affect trophic status, such as lake morphology, hydraulic residence time, temperature, internal nutrient cycling, or watershed contribution from multiple ecoregions.
4. All TP, TN, and Chl-a concentrations must be calculated as the geometric mean of a minimum of four (4) representative samples per year for one (1) year for purposes of comparison to lake ecore- gion criteria thresholds. All samples must be collected from the lake surface, near the outflow of the lake, and during the period May 1 – September 30.
5. Lakes with water quality that exceed Response Impairment Thresholds or Lake Site-Specific Criteria identified in Tables L and N are to be deemed impaired for excess nutrients.
6. Lakes are to be deemed impaired for excess nutrients if any of the following Response Assessment Endpoints are documented to occur within the same year as an exceedances of Nutrient Screening Thresholds in Table M. The department shall collect information on Response Assessment Endpoints concurrently with collection of Nutrient Screening Threshold parameters. The department shall determine attainment of Nutrient Criteria during the biennial assess- ment of Missouri waters.
A. Occurrence of eutrophication-related mortality or morbid- ity events for fish and other aquatic organisms;

  B. Epilimnetic excursions from dissolved oxygen or pH crite- ria;
C. Cyanobacteria counts in excess of one hundred thousand (100,000) cells per milliliter (cells/mL);
D. Observed shifts in aquatic diversity attributed to eutroph- ication; and
E. Excessive levels of mineral turbidity that consistently limit algal productivity during the period May 1 – September 30.
(S) Site-Specific Criteria Development for the Protection and Propagation of Fish, Shellfish, and Wildlife. When water quality cri- teria in this regulation are either underprotective or overprotective of water quality due to factors influencing bioavailability, or nonanthro- pogenic conditions for a given water body segment, a petitioner may request site-specific criteria. The petitioner must provide the depart- ment with sufficient documentation to show that the current criteria are not adequate and that the proposed site-specific criteria will pro- tect all existing and/or potential uses of the water body.
1. Site-specific criteria may be appropriate where, but is not limited to, the examples given in subparagraphs A. or B. of this para- graph.
A. The resident aquatic species of the selected water body have a different degree of sensitivity to a specific pollutant as com- pared to those species in the data set used to calculate the national or state criteria as described in either of the following parts:
(I) Natural adaptive processes have enabled a viable, bal- anced aquatic community to exist in waters where natural (non- anthropogenic) background conditions exceed the criterion (e.g., res- ident species have evolved a genetically-based greater tolerance to high concentrations of a chemical); or
(II) The composition of aquatic species in a water body is different from those used in deriving a criterion (e.g., most of the species considered among the most sensitive, such as salmonids or the cladoceran, Ceriodaphinia dubia, which were used in developing a criterion, are absent from a water body).
B. The physical and/or chemical characteristics of the water body alter the biological availability and/or toxicity of the pollutant (e.g., pH, alkalinity, salinity, water temperature, hardness). Such an example is the Water Effect Ratio (WER) defined at (1)(BB) of this rule.
2. All petitioners seeking to develop site-specific criteria shall coordinate with the department early in the process. This coordina- tion will ensure the use of adequate, relevant, and quality data; prop- er analysis and testing; and defendable procedures.
A. The department will provide guidance for establishing site-specific water quality criteria using scientific procedures includ- ing, but not limited to, those procedures described in:
(I) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Water Quality Standards Handbook, Second Edition, August 1994;
(II) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Interim Guidance on Determination and Use of Water-Effect Ratios for Metals (EPA-823-B-94-001) and subsequent 1997 modifications;
(III) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Streamlined Water-Effect Ratio Procedure for Discharges of Copper (EPA-822-R- 01-005); and
(IV) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Aquatic Life Ambient Freshwater Quality Criteria – Copper 2007 Revision (EPA- 822-R-07-001).
B. Site-specific criteria development for the Protection and Propagation of Fish, Shellfish, and Wildlife shall be performed using the guidance documents listed in parts (5)(S)2.A.(I)–(IV) as pub- lished by the Office of Science and Technology, Office of Water, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460, which are hereby incorporated by reference and do not include any later amendments or additions. The department shall maintain a copy of the referenced documents and shall make them available to the public for inspection and copying at no more than the actual cost of reproduction.
species and prevent acute and chronic toxicity in all parts of a water body.
4. Site-specific criteria shall include both chronic and acute concentrations to better reflect the different tolerances of resident species to the inherent variability between concentrations and toxico- logical characteristics of a chemical.
5. Site-specific criteria shall be clearly identified as maximum “not to be exceeded” or average values, and if an average, the aver- aging period and the minimum number of samples. The conditions, if any, when the criteria apply shall be clearly stated (e.g., specific levels of hardness, pH, or water temperature). Specific sampling requirements (e.g., location, frequency), if any, shall also be identi- fied.
6. The data, testing procedures, and application (safety) factors used to develop site-specific criteria shall reflect the nature of the chemical (e.g., persistency, bioaccumulation potential, and avoidance or attraction responses in fish) and the most sensitive resident species of a water body.
7. The size of a site may be limited to a single water segment, single water subsegment, or may cover a whole watershed depending on the particular situation for which the specific criterion is devel- oped. A group of water bodies may be considered one (1) site if their respective aquatic communities are similar in composition and have comparable water quality.
8. The department shall determine if a site-specific criterion is adequate and justifiable. The public notice shall include a description of the affected water body or water body segment and the reasons for applying the proposed criterion. If the department determines that there is significant public interest, a public hearing may be held in the geographical vicinity of the affected water body or water body segment. Any site-specific criterion promulgated under these provi- sions is subject to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approval prior to becoming effective for Clean Water Act purposes.
(12) Water Quality Standards Variances. A permittee or an applicant for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) or Missouri state operating permit may pursue a temporary variance pursuant to either section 644.061 or section 644.062, RSMo. A variance from water quality standards shall comply with 40 CFR 131.14.
(C) Variance terms and conditions, including facility name, permit number, receiving stream name, first classified water body ID, dis- charge location, highest attainable condition, effective permit date, and the variance expiration date will be incorporated into the Missouri Use Designation Dataset and Table J.
3. Site-specific criteria shall protect all life stages of resident

Additionally, six hundred seventy-one (671) individuals commented. This was a general comment that DHSS’ abortion regulations treat abortion providers differently than other providers, are medically unnecessary, and do not protect patient health and safety. RESPONSE: The comment does not contain any specific recommen- dations or concerns regarding any particular provisions of the rule. No change has made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #2: Sarah Willson, Vice President of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs, Missouri Hospital Association, commented that
the reference to section 188.052, RSMo was being removed from the purpose statement of 19 CSR 10-15.010 (Report of Induced Termination of Pregnancy) and requested that the reference be kept because it provides clarity that all abortions are to be reported. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Although sec- tion 188.052, RSMo does not need to be mentioned in the purpose statement of the rule for the statute’s requirement to apply, the pur- pose statement has been amended to add a reference to section 188.052, RSMo, and its requirement that all abortions be reported.
19 CSR 10-15.010 Report of Induced Termination of Pregnancy
PURPOSE: Under section 188.055, RSMo, the Department of Health and Senior Services is responsible for providing abortion forms to abortion facilities, hospitals, and physicians. This rule establishes the content of the report of induced termination of pregnancy to be filed with the department for statistical purposes for each abortion performed or induced as required by section 188.052, RSMo.

If you would like a list of individuals who submitted comments, please contact the Department of Health and Senior Services, Division of Community and Public Health, Kerri Tesreau, Acting Division Director, PO Box 570, Jefferson City, MO 65102-0570.

 Orders of Rulemaking
  Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that inconsistency exists between 19 CSR 10-15.020 and 19 CSR 30-30.050(1)(D) regarding the reference to “hemorrhage” as a type of complication. In 19 CSR 10-15.020, it is listed as “hemor- rhage” and in 19 CSR 30-30.050 it is listed as “excessive hemor- rhage.” They suggest that the term “hemorrhage” be used because the definition is inclusive of the term “excessive.”
RESPONSE: No changes have been made to this rule based on this comment. However, based upon this comment, 19 CSR 30- 30.050(1)(D) will be amended via separate final order to remove the word “excessive.”
COMMENT #3: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO of Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented regarding the use of “psychiatric” as a type of complication referenced in the proposed amendment to 19 CSR 10-15.020 and 19 CSR 30-30.050. They believe the term is inexact and not an actual condition. Therefore they recommend replacing “psychiatric” with “diagnosable psychiatric condition.”
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Based upon this comment, 19 CSR 10-15.020(1) and 19 CSR 30-30.050(1)(D) have been amended to state “diagnosable psychiatric condition” rather than “psychiatric.” DHSS is also amending the form Complication Report for Post-Abortion Care referenced in 19 CSR 10-15.020(1). The form date has been updated in section (1) of the rule.
19 CSR 10-15.020 Complication Report for Post-Abortion Care
(1) The complication report for post-abortion care shall contain the following items on a form provided by the department: patient iden- tification number; patient’s date of birth; residence of patient state, county, city; date of abortion; name and address of abortion facility or hospital; type of abortion performed; name and address of facility reporting complication; was patient previously seen at another facil- ity for post-abortion care (yes or no); if yes, name and address of other facility that treated patient; complications (check all that apply: incomplete abortion, hemorrhage, endometritis, parametritis, pyrex- ia, abscess-pelvic, uterine perforation, failed abortion-pregnancy undisturbed, retained products, cervical lacerations, diagnosable psy- chiatric condition, other-describe); result of complication (check all that apply: hysterectomy, death of woman, transfusion, other- describe); was patient hospitalized (yes or no); if yes, name and address of hospital; name and signature of physician providing post- abortion care; and date of this post-abortion care. The information shall be reported on the Complication Report for Post-Abortion Care which is incorporated by reference in this rule as published January 2018 and may be obtained at www.health.mo.gov or by calling (573) 751-6387. This rule does not incorporate any subsequent amend- ments or additions.

COMMENT #2: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO of Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that the fiscal note for the proposed amendment for 19 CSR 10-15.030 was not accurate because the mandatory histopathological exam increases the charge for each specimen.
RESPONSE: The statute, not the regulation, requires the histopatho- logical exam. No changes have been made to the fiscal note based on this comment.
COMMENT #3: Sarah Willson, Vice President of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs, Missouri Hospital Association, commented that the proposed amendment to 19 CSR 10-15.030 (Content and Filing of Tissue Report) did not address the perceived conflict between two (2) statutes and provide clear guidance as to how hospitals and physi- cians are to comply with these laws. Section 188.047, RSMo requires all tissue to be sent for gross and histopathological examina- tion. Sections 194.378 to 194.390, RSMo, recognize a mother’s right to determine the final disposition of fetal remains. RESPONSE: Based on the definition of “remains of a human fetus” in section 194.375, RSMo, section 194.378, RSMo appears to apply to miscarriages, not abortions. No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #4: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO of Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains; and Sarah Willson, Vice President of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs, Missouri Hospital Association, commented that the proposed amend- ment to 19 CSR 10-15.030(3) requiring “the physician who per- formed or induced the abortion shall provide the results of the gross and histopathological examination to the patient if the results contain information affecting her health or having a bearing on future preg- nancies” is beyond the statute in directing the details of medical prac- tice and imposes vague requirements on physicians that could open

  them up to liability. Planned Parenthood suggests this proposed amendment be revised to clarify that the physician is only required to follow up with a patient when the pathology lab has flagged her results as outside the normal range. Missouri Hospital Association suggests this proposed amendment be revised as “The physician may, based on his or her medical judgement and prevailing standards of care, provide the results...”
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Based upon these comments, 19 CSR 10-15.030(3) has been amended to state: The physician who performed or induced the abortion may, based on his or her medical judgment and prevailing standards of care, provide the results of the gross and histopathological examination to the patient.
19 CSR 10-15.030 Content and Filing of Tissue Report
(3) The physician who performed or induced the abortion may, based on his or her medical judgment and prevailing standards of care, pro- vide the results of the gross and histopathological examination to the patient.

Additionally, six hundred seventy-one (671) individuals commented. This was a general comment that DHSS’ abortion regulations treat abortion providers differently than other providers, are medically unnecessary, and do not protect patient health and safety.
RESPONSE: The comment does not contain any specific recommen- dations or concerns regarding any particular provisions of the rule. No change has made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #2: Sarah Willson, Vice President of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs, Missouri Hospital Association, commented that parts of 19 CSR 10-15.050 are not in alignment with other regulatory expectations of hospitals.
RESPONSE: The comment does not include any specifics regarding provisions that are not in alignment with other expectations. No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #3: Paul J. Scheel, Jr., M.D., Associate Vice Chancellor for Clinical Affairs and CEO, Faculty Practice Plan, Washington University Physicians and Washington University School of Medicine, commented that 19 CSR 10-15.050(2)(I) requiring the complication plan to be included in the patient’s medical record is confusing and beyond the scope of section 188.021.2., RSMo. RESPONSE: 19 CSR 10-15.050(2)(I) does not require the complica- tion plan to be included in the patient’s medical record. No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #4: Paul J. Scheel, Jr., M.D., Associate Vice Chancellor for Clinical Affairs and CEO, Faculty Practice Plan, Washington University Physicians and Washington University School of Medicine, commented that 19 CSR 10-15.050(2)(I) could be read to require the complication report to be included in the medical record which is beyond the scope of section 188.052, RSMo. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: 19 CSR 10- 15.050(2)(I) has been amended to remove the requirement that the complication report be included in the patient’s medical record.
COMMENT #5: DHSS staff commented that the counterpart to this proposed rule, 19 CSR 30-30.061 (pertaining to complication plans for abortion facilities) is being amended to clarify the phone number a patient must be given before discharge. That amendment is being made based upon a comment received. Because this rule contains the same phone number requirement, this rule should be clarified as well.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: 19 CSR 10- 15.050(2)(J) has been amended to add: “The phone number given may be for the on-call service rather than the OB/GYN’s direct num- ber.”
COMMENT #6: Sarah Willson, Vice President of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs, Missouri Hospital Association, commented that 19 CSR 10-15.050 regarding complication plans for hospitals does

 Orders of Rulemaking
  not reference the emergency exception for complication plans con- tained in section 188.021, RSMo.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Although the statutory exception applies regardless of whether it is referenced in the rule, for ease, a reference to the exception has been added to the rule in 19 CSR 10-15.050(3).
19 CSR 10-15.050 Complication Plans for Certain Drug- and Chemically-Induced Abortions by Physicians via Hospitals
(2) Complication plans for certain drug- and chemically-induced abortions.
(I) Every complication plan shall require that the OB/GYN treat- ing a patient’s complication shall prepare a complication report as required by section 188.052, RSMo and ensure that it is submitted to the department.
(J) The physician shall ensure that before discharge, every patient who receives a drug also receives the phone number, in writing, for the OB/GYN or OB/GYN group providing complication coverage. The phone number given may be for the on-call service rather than the OB/GYN’s direct number.
(3) Pursuant to section 188.021.2, RSMo, no complication plan is required where the patient is administered the drug in a medical emergency at a hospital and is then treated as an inpatient at a hospital under medical monitoring by the hospital until the abortion is completed.

COMMENT #2: Helen Wood, RN, BSN, CIC and David K.

RESPONSE: The PAS file layout referenced in the rules does not include a variable of physician name. The only way that PAS data could be used to identify a physician’s name is through the physician number (listed as Physician ID on the file layout). The physician number is already listed in the rule as a variable that is not available for subsequent release. No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.

COMMENT #2: Helen Wood, RN, BSN, CIC and David K. Warren, MD, MPH on behalf of Barnes Jewish Hospital, recognize that the reporting requirements for ICUs and wards in the proposed amend- ment of 19 CSR 10-33.050 aligns with CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) reporting requirements and will not add any additional burden to the hospital.
RESPONSE: As recognized, DHSS has attempted to bring 19 CSR 10-33.050 into closer alignment with federal CMS reporting require- ments. No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #3: Sarah Willson, Vice President of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs, Missouri Hospital Association, requests that 19 CSR 10-33.050(1)(G) be amended to include psychiatric hospitals as an exclusion for reporting due to the extremely low volume, if any, of patients diagnosed with a reportable Hospital Acquired Infection. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: DHSS agrees with the comment above and also recommends revision to exclude rehabilitation hospitals for the same reason. DHSS is amending 19 CSR 10-33.050(1)(G) to exclude psychiatric and rehabilitation hospi- tals, in addition to critical access hospitals and long term acute care hospitals, from Health Care-Associated Infection Rate reporting requirements.
19 CSR 10-33.050 Reporting of Healthcare-Associated Infection Rates by Hospitals, Ambulatory Surgical Centers, and Abortion Facilities

  COMMENT #2: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that the definition of “abortion” in 19 CSR 30-30.050(1)(A) should be the same as the statutory definition.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Based on this comment, the definition of “abortion” in 19 CSR 30-30.050(1)(A) has been amended to match the definition in section 188.015, RSMo.
COMMENT #3: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that inconsistency exists between 19 CSR 10-15.020 and 19 CSR 30-30.050(1)(D) regarding the reference of “hemorrhage” as a type of complication. In 19 CSR10-15.020, it is listed as “hemor- rhage” and in 19 CSR 30-30.050 it is listed as “excessive hemor- rhage.” They suggest that the term “hemorrhage” be used because the definition is inclusive of the term excessive.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Based upon this comment, 19 CSR 30-30.050(1)(D) has been amended to remove the word “excessive.”
COMMENT #4: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented regarding the use of “psychiatric” as a type of complication referenced in the proposed amendment to 19 CSR 10-15.020 and 19 CSR 30-30.050. They believe the term is inexact and not an actual condition. Therefore they recommend replacing “psychiatric” with “diagnosable psychiatric condition.”
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Based upon this comment, 19 CSR 10-15.020(1) (via a separate final order) and 19 CSR 30-30.050(1)(D) have been amended to state “diagnosable psy- chiatric condition” rather than “psychiatric.”
COMMENT #5: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that 19 CSR 30-30.050(2)(B) requires provision of informa- tion on abortion facility licensure applications that is unusual, goes beyond what is required of ambulatory surgical centers, and may compromise the safety of abortion facilities and their staff if made public. They ask that “name and qualifications of OB/GYN consul- tant,” “name and qualifications of administrator,” “estimated num- ber of each type of abortion that will be performed and/or induced annually at facility,” “number of physicians routinely performing or inducing abortions at facility,” “usual days and times that abortions are induced or performed at facility,” and “number of procedure rooms” be removed from the application form requirements con- tained in the rule.
RESPONSE: 19 CSR 30-30.050(2)(B) is a list of information that is generally already requested on the Application for Abortion Facility License and the ASC License Addendum Data for Facility which have been in use for a number of years. This information helps the Bureau of Ambulatory Care confirm that certain preliminary require- ments have been met before scheduling an inspection. The informa- tion also helps the Bureau schedule its unannounced inspections so that procedures will be occurring on the date of the inspection. No change has been made based on this comment.
COMMENT #6: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com-
mented that 19 CSR 30-30.050(2)(I) requires an abortion facility to be in compliance with all requirements of applicable regulations and statutes rather than in substantial compliance before receiving a license.
RESPONSE: The compliance requirement is in the existing regula- tion. No changes have been made based on this comment.
19 CSR 30-30.050 Definitions and Procedures for Licensing Abortion Facilities
(1) The following definitions shall be used in the interpretation and enforcement of 19 CSR 30-30.060 and 19 CSR 30-30.070:

COMMENT #2: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that 19 CSR 30-30.060(1)(C)4. retains the hospital relation- ship requirement for physicians performing abortions, which has been challenged as unconstitutional and is not required by SB5. RESPONSE: 19 CSR 30-30.060(1)(C)4. is the subject of pending lit- igation against the department. No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #3: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that there is no strong justification for the requirement in 19 CSR 30-30.060(1)(C)5. that the required physician consultant be an OB/GYN and asks that “OB/GYN” be changed to “qualified physi- cian” or “appropriately-qualified physician.”
RESPONSE: The requirement that the consultant be an OB/GYN is in the existing rule. No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #4: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, request- ed that 19 CSR 30-30.060(2)(E) not require ultrasounds to be per- formed by physicians or individuals with current certification by the American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS). They suggest that the rule should instead require ultrasounds to be performed by physicians or “qualified persons under the supervision of a physician.”
RESPONSE: 19 CSR 30-30.060(2)(E) authorizes performance of ultrasounds by persons with “other certified training deemed accept- able by the department,” not just physicians and those with ARDMS certification. No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #5: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that 19 CSR 30-30.060(2)(D) should not require a pelvic exam of each patient but should instead require only a health assess- ment.
RESPONSE: The requirement of a pelvic exam is in the existing reg- ulation. No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #6: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that 19 CSR 30-30.060(2)(D), requiring an ultrasound exam- ination for every patient seeking an abortion after the first trimester, be removed from the rule.
RESPONSE: This requirement is in the existing regulation at (3)(C). No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #7: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that the requirement in 19 CSR 30-30.060(2)(F) requiring an RN, LPN, or surgical technician to be in the procedure room when a patient is in the procedure room, is unnecessary and should be
changed to require such presence only at the time a surgical abortion is provided.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Based on this comment, the third sentence of 19 CSR 30-30.060(2)(F) has been amended to add, “For surgical abortions,” before “an RN, LPN, . . . shall be present.”
COMMENT #8: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that it is medically unnecessary for abortion facilities to be required to maintain certain emergency drugs and equipment (19 CSR 30-30.060(2)(M), (N)) if the facility does not use moderate or higher levels of sedation.
RESPONSE: These requirements are contained in the existing regu- lation at (3)(I) and (L). No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #9: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that abortion facilities should not be required (by 19 CSR 30- 30.060(5)) to perform periodic checks with their contracted patholo- gy labs to ensure that the labs are submitting tissue reports to the department as required by section 188.047, RSMo.
RESPONSE: No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #10: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that 19 CSR 30-30.060(8)(B)10. should not require an abor- tion facility’s quality assessment program to include a documented review of the number and percentage of medical abortion patients who fail to return to the facility for follow-up to confirm completion of the abortion, and common reasons why.
RESPONSE: No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.

 Orders of Rulemaking
  19 CSR 30-30.061 is adopted.
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on December 1, 2017 (42 MoReg 1785–1788). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations.
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) received the same or similar comments from six hundred seventy-one (671) individuals, one (1) comment from the Missouri Section Advisory Council of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, two (2) comments from Planned Parenthood, one (1) comment from the Missouri Hospital Association, and one (1) DHSS staff comment. If you would like a list of individuals who submitted comments, please contact the Department of Health and Senior Services, Dean Linneman, Division Director, Division of Regulation and Licensure, PO Box 570, Jefferson City, MO 65102-0570.
COMMENT #1: On behalf of the Missouri Section Advisory Council (SAC) of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the following people commented: Peter Greenspan, DO, FACOG, Chair; Mistie Mills, MD, FACOG, Secretary/Treasurer; Colleen McNicholas, MD, FACOG; Ravi Johar, MD, FACOG, Vice-Chair; Octavio Chirino, MD, FACOG, Immediate Past Chair; and Sandra Ahlum, MD, FACOG. Additionally, six hundred seventy-one (671) individuals commented. This was a general comment that DHSS’ abortion regulations treat abortion providers differently than other providers, are medically unnecessary, and do not protect patient health and safety. RESPONSE: The comment does not contain any specific recommen- dations or concerns regarding any particular provisions of the rule. No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #2: DHSS staff commented that the counterpart to this proposed rule (19 CSR 10-15.050 regarding complication plans for hospitals) is being changed based on a comment received to not require the complication report to be included in the patient’s med- ical record.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: So that this rule for abortion facilities is consistent with the rule for hospitals, 19 CSR 30-30.061(2)(I) has been amended to remove the requirement that the complication report be included in the patient’s medical record.
COMMENT #3: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO of Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, request- ed that the 19 CSR 30-30.061 be amended to state a geographic limit for the OB/GYN providing complication coverage and to state whether the OB/GYN providing complication coverage must have hospital privileges within a geographic limit from the abortion facil- ity.
RESPONSE: As stated in 19 CSR 30-30.061(2)(G), the OB/GYN providing complication coverage must be able to personally treat complications, including those requiring surgical intervention, except as indicated in that provision. No change has been made to the rule based on this comment.
COMMENT #4: Mary M. Kogut, MBA, BSW, President and CEO or Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region; and Aaron Samulcek, Interim President and CEO, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, com- mented that 19 CSR 30-30.061 (regarding complication plans for abortion facilities as required by section 188.021, RSMo), is med- ically unnecessary, inconsistent with the standard of care, and uncon- stitutional. They request that the regulation be amended to allow a
physician other than an OB/GYN to provide back-up coverage; elim- inate the requirement that a pre-identified OB/GYN or other physi- cian be available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week (24/7) to assess, treat, or arrange handoff to another physician; and elimi- nate the requirement that the patient be given direct contact informa- tion for a physician.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: 19 CSR 30- 30.061 is the subject of pending litigation against the department. One (1) change has been made to the rule based on this comment: 19 CSR 30-30.061(2)(J) has been amended to add: “The phone number given may be for the on-call service rather than the OB/GYN’s direct number.”
COMMENT #5: Sarah Willson, Vice President of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs, Missouri Hospital Association, commented that 19 CSR 30-30.061, a regulation pertaining to complication plans for abortion facilities, referenced hospitals in (2)(K) instead of abortion facilities.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The reference to “hospital” in 19 CSR 30-30.061(2)(K) was an error and has been changed to “abortion facility.”
19 CSR 30-30.061 Complication Plans for Certain Drug- and Chemically-Induced Abortions Via Abortion Facilities
(2) Complication plans for certain drug- and chemically-induced abortions.
(I) Every complication plan shall require that the OB/GYN treat- ing a patient’s complication shall prepare a complication report as required by section 188.052, RSMo and ensure that it is submitted to the department.
(J) The abortion facility shall ensure that before discharge, every patient who receives a drug via the facility also receives the phone number, in writing, for the OB/GYN or OB/GYN group providing complication coverage. The phone number given may be for the on- call service rather than the OB/GYN’s direct number.
(K) The physician or abortion facility shall submit complication plans to the department for approval in writing using the complica- tion plan submission form provided by the department. The form shall require at least the following information:
1. The full name of each physician whose prescription or administration of drugs via the facility will be covered by the plan;
2. The full name of the OB/GYN who will provide complication coverage, or if an OB/GYN group will provide coverage, the full legal name of the group and the full name of each OB/GYN who is part of the group; and
3. A description of how the complication plan meets each requirement in this regulation, including treating complications requir- ing surgical intervention.
