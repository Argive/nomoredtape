ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission under sections 226.020 and 227.240, RSMo 2016, the commission amends a rule as follows: 
7 CSR 10-3.010 Location and Relocation of Utility Facilities on State Highways is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on December 15, 2017 (42 MoReg 1825–1831). No changes have been made in the text of the proposed amendment, so it is not reprinted here. This pro- posed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission received one (1) comment on the pro- posed amendment. 
COMMENT #1: On January 9, 2018, AquaLaw PLC attorney Kate Claflin Creef wrote an email on behalf of the Association of Missouri Clean Water Agencies (AMCA) to Commission Secretary Pam Harlan. Creef wrote that AMCA asked that 7 CSR 10-3.010(4)(B)2.B. be amended to require that encased utilities have detector tape placed one foot (1') above the backfill, instead of placed one foot (1') above the encasement. 
RESPONSE: On February 9, 2018, MoDOT staff discussed the com- ment with the originator of AMCA’s comment, Mark Griffin, from the Kansas City Water District (KCWD). KCWD was concerned about the limits of the detector tape but after discussion understands the intent of the rule and has withdrawn their comment. As a result, the final order for this rule does not incorporate the public comment, and does not change the rule previously approved by the commission.

Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2220—State Board of Pharmacy Chapter 6—Pharmaceutical Care Standards 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Board of Pharmacy under sections 338.140 and 338.280, RSMo 2016, and section 330.010.1, RSMo Supp. 2017, the board amends a rule as follows: 
20 CSR 2220-6.040 is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on January 16, 2018 (43 MoReg 86–88). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The board received six (6) comments in response to the proposed amendment. 
COMMENT #1: CVS Health asked the board to amend subsection (6)(B) to allow production of required records within twenty-four (24) hours of a request from the board or the board’s designee in lieu of the proposed two (2) hours. 
RESPONSE: The proposed two (2) hour production of records requirement is consistent with other board records requirements and appropriate for the nature of activities being performed. No change has been made in response to the comment. 
COMMENT #2: CVS Health suggested modifying subsection (7)(A) to clarify that notification to the patient’s primary health care provider is only required if a primary health care provider is identi- fied by the patient. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The comment is consistent with the board’s intent. Subsection (7)(A) has been amend- ed as suggested to provide clarity. 
COMMENT #3: CVS Health suggested the board delete proposed section (8) which requires biennial filing of a Notification of Intent to administer medication by prescription order. RESPONSE: The biennial notification requirement would allow the board to identify and track pharmacists administering medication by prescription order. Significantly, the proposed amendment aligns the required notification with pharmacy renewals to better accommodate licensees and reduce required filings. No change has been made in response to the comment. 
COMMENT #4: The Missouri Academy of Family Physicians (MAFP) opposed amending paragraph (6)(A)4. which would require that pharmacist administration records include the name and address of the patient’s primary health care provider or an “indication that a primary health care provider was not provided.” MAFP suggested the amendment is unnecessary because the prescription order must have originated from a provider, prescriber, or physician. RESPONSE: While the prescription order must originate from an authorized prescriber, the patient may not have a “primary health care provider.” This issue was specifically raised with indigent or uninsured patients that may not be under a healthcare practitioner’s regular care. The proposed amendment was intended to clarify that pharmacy records must clearly identify when a primary health care provider is not designated or identified by the patient. No change has been made in response to the comment. 
COMMENT #5: MAFP suggested the board retain the seventy-two (72) hour prescriber notification requirement. 
RESPONSE: The board has received complaints from both pre- scribers and pharmacists indicating the seventy-two (72) hour notifi- cation requirement is burdensome and unnecessary. The board believes the proposed fourteen (14) day notification will protect the public while reducing unnecessary regulation. Additionally, section 338.010.13, RSMo, requires notification to the primary health care provider within fourteen (14) days of administering a vaccine. No change has been made in response to the comment. 
COMMENT #6: MAFP suggested the board mandate reporting to the state immunization registry to prevent duplicate and unnecessary immunizations. RESPONSE: The board agrees reporting to the state immunization registry would be beneficial for both prescribers and patients. Legislation is currently pending to require ShowMeVax reporting as suggested. Accordingly, no change has been made in response to the comment at this time. However, the board may reconsider the sug- gestion if legislation is not enacted. 
20 CSR 2220-6.040 Administration by Medical Prescription Order 
(7) Notification Requirements. Pharmacists administering or super- vising administration of medication under this rule, shall ensure: 
(A) The patient’s primary health care provider, if provided by the patient, is notified of the following within fourteen (14) days of administering a vaccine: 
1. The identity of the patient; 2. The vaccine administered; 3. The route of administration; 4. The anatomic site of the administration; 5. The dose administered; and 
6. The date of administration;

Title 4—DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Division 340—Division of Energy Chapter 2—Energy Loan Program 
IN ADDITION Notification: Applications accepted between May 15, 2018 and July 
15, 2018 for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Loan Cycle. 
The Missouri Department of Economic Development’s (department) Division of Energy is making available approximately two and one- half (2.5) million dollars in loan financing for qualified energy effi- ciency and renewable energy projects. Energy-saving investments may include projects such as insulation, lighting systems, heating and cooling systems, combined heat and power, pumps, motors, aerators, renewable energy systems, and other measures that reduce energy use and cost. Recipients repay loans with money saved on energy costs. 
Eligible Energy-Using Sectors: Loan funds will be allocated to eli- gible energy-using sectors as follows: 
Combined Heat and Power Projects (CHP) – 50% of available funds: 
• City/County owned and operated nursing homes or assisted liv- ing facilities; 
• Public and Private Higher Education Institutions; • Public and Private not-for-profit Hospitals; and • City/County owned and operated correctional facilities. 
Any energy-saving project – 50% of available funds: 
• Public and Private not-for-profit Hospitals. 
Application Procedures: An application for loan funds may be sub- mitted to the department for the purpose of financing all or a portion of the cost of implementing an energy-saving project. 
Each applicant may apply for a loan not to exceed one (1) million dollars. Loan applications will not be considered for less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or with a payback score of less than six (6) months. 
If funds remain after review and priority ranking of applications, the department will consider awarding loans in excess of one (1) million dollars. 
Requests for loan financing must be made using the Division of Energy’s Energy Loan Program Application Authorization Form, Fuel Use Summary Form, and Energy Conservation Measure Summary Form. Application forms and instructions are available on the department’s website: http://energyloan.mo.gov. 
The Application Authorization Form must be signed and dated by an authorized official. An authorized official is an individual with authority to obligate an eligible applicant to the terms of loan agree- 
ment and promissory note to repay loan proceeds. 
A paper or electronic copy of the signed original Application Authorization Form and required documents may be submitted to the department’s address below. 
Applications received after July 15, 2018 will not be considered for a loan award for this 2018 special cycle but may be held for consid- eration during subsequent application cycles. 
The department may request additional information as needed to determine the feasibility of a project, the project’s estimated annual energy savings, and financial risks of a loan transaction. Also, an energy conservation measure has the potential of affecting other areas within the facility or system. Applicants must have no outstanding actions for violations of applicable federal, state, or local laws, ordi- nances, and rules. 
Interest Rates: Loan principal plus two and three quarters percent (2.75%) interest is to be repaid to the department in semi-annual pay- ments not to exceed a ten (10) year repayment period. An adminis- trative fee of one percent (1%) of loan principal will be added to the repayment amount. 
Selection Criteria: Recipients of loan financing will be determined on a competitive basis. Applications will be ranked based on the pro- ject’s payback score, which is determined by dividing the cost to implement a project by the estimated yearly energy cost savings. Projects with the lowest payback score in each sector allocation will be funded until all available funds are allocated. If all funds are not allocated in any one (1) sector after ranking payback scores, the department may allocate funds to other sectors. Loan applications will be approved or disapproved by October 15, 2018.
