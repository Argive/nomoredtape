HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO 
RULES 
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system– 
Title Division Chapter Rule 
3 CSR 10- 4 .115 Department Code of Agency General area Specific area 
State Division regulated regulated Regulations 
and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115. 
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a. 
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation, for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115 NOT Rule 10-4.115. Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated. 
Code and Register on the Internet 
The Code of State Regulations and Missouri Register are available on the Internet. The Code address is www.sos.mo.gov/adrules/csr/csr The Register address is www.sos.mo.gov/adrules/moreg/moreg These websites contain rulemakings and regulations as they appear in the Code and Registers.

Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]

been set for hearing knowing that the setting conflicts with a prior obligation of that representative. Representatives shall include attorneys, agents, or employer representatives.]

Title 4—DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Division 340—Division of Energy Chapter 2—Energy Loan Program 
IN ADDITION 
Notification: Applications accepted between January 2, 2018 and March 30, 2018 for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Loan Cycle. 
The Missouri Department of Economic Development’s (department) Division of Energy is making available approximately five (5) million dollars in loan financing for qualified energy efficiency and renew- able energy projects. Energy-saving investments may include projects such as insulation, lighting systems, heating and cooling systems, combined heat and power, pumps, motors, aerators, renewable ener- gy systems, and other measures that reduce energy use and cost. Recipients repay loans with money saved on energy costs. 
Eligible Energy-Using Sectors: Loan funds will be allocated to eli- gible energy-using sectors as follows: 
• Public Schools (K-12): twenty-five percent (25%) of available funds; 
• Public and Private Higher Education Institutions: twenty-five percent (25%) of available funds; 
• Public and Private not-for-profit Hospitals: twenty-five percent (25%) of available funds; and 
• Local Governments: twenty-five percent (25%) of available funds. Local governments include a county, city, or village (which may include water treatment plants or waste water facil- ities), local government/public owned airport facilities (munic- ipal, county, regional, and international); or any hospital dis- trict as defined in section 206.010, RSMo; or any sewer district as defined in section 249.010, RSMo; or any water supply dis- tricts as defined in section 247.010, RSMo; or any ambulance district as defined in section 190.010, RSMo; or any sub-dis- trict of a zoological park and museum district as defined in sec- tion 184.352, RSMo. 
Application Procedures: An application for loan funds may be sub- mitted to the department for the purpose of financing all or a portion of the cost of implementing an energy-saving project. 
Each applicant may apply for a loan not to exceed one (1) million dollars. Loan applications will not be considered for less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or with a payback score of less than six (6) months. 
If funds remain after review and priority ranking of applications, the department will consider awarding loans in excess of one (1) million dollars. 
Requests for loan financing must be made using the Division of Energy’s Energy Loan Program Application Authorization Form, Fuel Use Summary Form, and Energy Conservation Measure Summary 
Form. Application forms and instructions are available on the depart- ment’s website: https://energyloan.mo.gov. 
The Application Authorization Form must be signed and dated by an authorized official. An authorized official is an individual with authority to obligate an eligible applicant to the terms of loan agree- ment and promissory note to repay loan proceeds. 
A paper or electronic copy of the signed original Application Authorization Form and required documents may be submitted to the department’s address below. 
Applications received after March 30, 2018 will not be considered for a loan award for this 2018 supplemental cycle but may be held for consideration during subsequent application cycles. 
The department may request additional information as needed to determine the feasibility of a project, the project’s estimated annual energy savings, and financial risks of a loan transaction. Also, an energy conservation measure has the potential of affecting other areas within the facility or system. Applicants must have no outstanding actions for violations of applicable federal, state, or local laws, ordi- nances, and rules. 
Interest Rates: Loan principal plus two and three quarters percent (2.75%) interest is to be repaid to the department in semi-annual pay- ments not to exceed a ten- (10-) year repayment period. An adminis- trative fee of one percent (1%) of loan principal will be added to the repayment amount. 
Selection Criteria: Recipients of loan financing will be determined on a competitive basis. Applications will be ranked based on the pro- ject’s payback score, which is determined by dividing the cost to implement a project by the estimated yearly energy cost savings. Projects with the lowest payback score in each sector allocation will be funded until all available funds are allocated. If all funds are not allocated in any one (1) sector after ranking payback scores, the department may allocate funds to other sectors. Loan applications will be approved or disapproved by June 30, 2018.
