  Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION
IN ADDITION
Section 538.210.8, RSMo, requires the Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration to annually adjust the cap on non-economic damages in medical mal- practice cases by 1.7 percent. The caps for 2018 are calculated below.
The new limit was established by the following calculation:
Cap for non-catastrophic injuries in 2017: $413,716 Cap for catastrophic injuries in 2017: $724,900
New caps:
Non-catastrophic injuries: ($413,716 × 1.017) = $420,749 Catastrophic injuries: ($724,002 × 1.017) = $736,310
