HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO 
RULES 
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system– 
Title Division Chapter Rule 
3 CSR 10- 4 .115 Department Code of Agency General area Specific area 
State Division regulated regulated Regulations 
and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115. 
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a. 
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation, for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115 NOT Rule 10-4.115. Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated.

March 1, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 5 
Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 30—Animal Health Chapter 10—Food Safety and Meat Inspection 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 2 CSR 30-10.010 Inspection of Meat and Poultry. The director is 
amending section (2). 
PURPOSE: This amendment ensures that the current rule language clearly includes the most recent publication of Part 300 to end of Title 9, the Code of Federal Regulations for the Missouri Meat and Poultry Inspection Program to be in compliance with federal regula- tions and maintain “equal to” status as determined by the United States Department of Agriculture/Food Safety and Inspection Service. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: This emergency amendment is neces- sary to serve the compelling governmental interest to inform state agencies and the public of the most current adoption of Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations Part 300 to end is incorporated into state reg- ulation. The State Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) programs are required to operate in a manner and with authorities that are “at least equal to” the antemortem and postmortem inspection, re- inspection, sanitation, recordkeeping, and enforcement provisions as provided for in the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act. State MPI programs must stay current with and be able to explain how their programs are equal to FSIS regula- tions to ensure their rules are “at least equal to” USDA/FSIS and in 
compliance with federal regulations. Therefore, an amendment to clarify the most current federal meat and poultry inspection regula- tions are being incorporated by reference and provide enforcement authority in Missouri. This regulation applies to approximately thir- ty-six (36) state inspected meat and poultry establishments and one hundred fifty-five (155) custom exempt plants in Missouri, which as a whole, produces millions of dollars in Missouri’s economy. This emergency amendment protects the public health, safety, and/or wel- fare under a compelling governmental interest, which requires this emergency action. A proposed amendment, which covers the same material, is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. The scope of this emergency amendment is limited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The Department of Agriculture believes this emergency amendment is fair to all interest- ed persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency amendment was filed January 30, 2018, becomes effective February 9, 2018, and expires August 7, 2018. 
(2) The standards used to inspect Missouri meat and poultry slaugh- ter and processing shall be those shown in Part 300 to end of Title 9, the Code of Federal Regulations (January 201[7]8), herein incorpo- rated by reference and made a part of this rule as published by the United States Superintendent of Documents, 732 N Capitol Street NW, Washington, DC 20402-0001, phone: toll-free (866) 512-1800, DC area (202) 512-1800, website: http://bookstore.gpo.gov. This rule does not incorporate any subsequent amendments or additions. 
AUTHORITY: section 265.020, RSMo 2016. Original rule filed Sept. 14, 2000, effective March 30, 2001. For intervening history, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Emergency amendment filed Jan. 30, 2018, effective Feb. 9, 2018, expires Aug. 7, 2018. A pro- posed amendment covering this same material is published in this issue of the Missouri Register.

MISSOURI Proposed Rules March 1, 2018 REGISTER Vol. 43, No. 5 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 2 CSR 30-10.010 Inspection of Meat and Poultry. The director is 
amending section (2). 
PURPOSE: This amendment ensures that the current rule language clearly includes the most recent publication of Part 300 to end of Title 9, the Code of Federal Regulations for the Missouri Meat and Poultry Inspection Program to be in compliance with federal regula- tions and maintain “equal to” status as determined by the United States Department of Agriculture/Food Safety and Inspection Service. 
(2) The standards used to inspect Missouri meat and poultry slaugh- ter and processing shall be those shown in Part 300 to end of Title 9, 
the Code of Federal Regulations (January 201[7]8), herein incorpo- rated by reference and made a part of this rule as published by the United States Superintendent of Documents, 732 N Capitol Street NW, Washington, DC, 20402-0001, phone: toll-free (866) 512-1800, DC area (202) 512-1800, website: http://bookstore.gpo.gov. This rule does not incorporate any subsequent amendments or additions. 
AUTHORITY: section 265.020, RSMo 2016. Original rule filed Sept. 14, 2000, effective March 30, 2001. For intervening history, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Emergency amendment filed Jan. 30, 2018, effective Feb. 9, 2018, expires Aug. 7, 2018. Amended: Filed Jan. 30, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed amendment will not cost state agen- cies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed amendment will not cost private enti- ties more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed amendment with the Missouri Department of Agriculture, Dr. Linda Hickam, PO Box 630, Jefferson City, MO 65102 or by email to Linda.Hickam@mda.mo.gov. To be considered, comments must be received within thirty (30) days of publication of this notice in the Missouri Register. No public hear- ing is scheduled. 
Title 12—DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE Division 10—Director of Revenue Chapter 2—Income Tax 
PROPOSED RESCISSION 
12 CSR 10-2.020 Difference in Basis on December 31, 1972. This rule served as a guideline in the determination of the amount of indi- vidual, corporate or other taxpayer’s allowable modification upon the sale or other disposition of property having a higher adjusted basis for Missouri income tax purposes than for federal income tax pur- poses on December 31, 1972. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it is obsolete and unnecessary. It describes the modification to federal adjusted gross income required in section 143.121.3(2), RSMo, for gains from the sale of property having higher adjusted basis for Missouri income tax purposes than for federal income tax purposes on December 31, 1972. Due to depreciation schedules, that difference would no longer exist for property of that age. 
AUTHORITY: section 143.961, RSMo 1986. Regulation 1.121-3(b) was originally filed March 15, 1974, effective March 25, 1974. Rescinded: Filed Jan. 18, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rescission will not cost state agencies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed rescission will not cost private enti- ties more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed rescission with the Missouri Department of Revenue, General Counsel’s Office, PO Box 475, Jefferson City, MO 65105-0475. To be considered, comments must be received within thirty (30) days after publication of this notice in the Missouri Register. No public hearing is scheduled.

Title 12—DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE Division 10—Director of Revenue Chapter 2—Income Tax 
PROPOSED RESCISSION 
12 CSR 10-2.025 Adjustment to Avoid Double Taxation. This rule served as a guideline in the determination of the amount of a taxpay- er’s allowable modification with respect to any item of income or gain which was properly included in taxable income and taxed under the Missouri income tax law in effect prior to January 1, 1973. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it is obsolete and unnecessary. It describes the modification to federal adjusted gross income required in section 143.121.3(3), RSMo, for income taxed under Missouri law for a taxable year prior to 1973. This situation should not exist at this time. 
AUTHORITY: section 143.961, RSMo 1986. Regulation 1.121-3(c) was originally filed March 15, 1974, effective March 25, 1974. Rescinded: Filed Jan. 18, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rescission will not cost state agencies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed rescission will not cost private enti- ties more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed rescission with the Missouri Department of Revenue, General Counsel’s Office, PO Box 475, Jefferson City, MO 65105-0475. To be considered, comments must be received within thirty (30) days after publication of this notice in the Missouri Register. No public hearing is scheduled. 
Title 12—DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE Division 10—Director of Revenue Chapter 2—Income Tax 
PROPOSED RESCISSION 
12 CSR 10-2.120 Information at Source Reporting Requirements. This rule specified methods of reporting miscellaneous income from Missouri sources. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it is obsolete. It concerns reporting payments made by certain payors, but it does not reflect changes to the requirements contained in a 2016 amendment to section 143.591, RSMo. 
AUTHORITY: section 143.591, RSMo 1994. Original rule filed Jan. 15, 1985, effective June 13, 1985. Rescinded: Filed Jan. 18, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rescission will not cost state agencies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed rescission will not cost private enti- ties more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed rescission with the Missouri Department of Revenue, General Counsel’s Office, PO Box 475, Jefferson City, MO 65105-0475. To be considered, comments must be received within thirty (30) days after publication of this notice in the Missouri Register. No public hearing is scheduled. 
Title 12—DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE Division 10—Director of Revenue Chapter 3—State Sales Tax 
PROPOSED RESCISSION 12 CSR 10-3.002 Rules. This rule was a general statement describ- 
ing the nature of all sales tax rules. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it does not incorpo- rate section 144.021, RSMo, and therefore is incomplete. The rule does not contain the requirements that the department must notify affected taxpayers before certain changes in the sales and use tax law may apply to the affected taxpayers. 
AUTHORITY: section 144.270, RSMo 1994. S.T. regulation 270-2 was last filed Dec. 31, 1975, effective Jan. 10, 1976. Refiled March 30, 1976. Amended: Filed Aug. 6, 1980, effective Jan. 1, 1981. Rescinded: Filed Jan. 18, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rescission will not cost state agencies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed rescission will not cost private enti- ties more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed rescission with the Missouri Department of Revenue, General Counsel’s Office, PO Box 475, Jefferson City, MO 65105-0475. To be considered, comments must be received within thirty (30) days after publication of this notice in the Missouri Register. No public hearing is scheduled. 
Title 12—DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE Division 10—Director of Revenue Chapter 3—State Sales Tax 
PROPOSED RESCISSION 
12 CSR 10-3.018 Truckers Engaged in Retail Business. This rule interpreted the sales tax law as it applied to truckers engaged in retail business and interpreted and applied section 144.010, RSMo. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it does not suffi- ciently inform taxpayers of their obligations to collect and remit state and local sales tax. Further, the information in this rule is contained within section 144.021, RSMo. Taxpayers may refer to the statute and to 12 CSR 10-117.100 for their remittance obligations. 
AUTHORITY: section 144.270, RSMo 1994. This rule was previously filed as rule no. 48 Jan. 22, 1973, effective Feb. 1, 1973. S.T. reg- ulation 010-7 was last filed Dec. 31, 1975, effective Jan. 10, 1976. Refiled March 30, 1976. Amended: Filed Aug. 13, 1980, effective Jan. 1, 1981. Rescinded: Filed Jan. 18, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rescission will not cost state agencies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed rescission will not cost private enti- ties more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed rescission with the Missouri Department of Revenue, General Counsel’s Office, PO Box 475, Jefferson City, MO 65105-0475. To be considered, comments

Title 12—DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE Division 10—Director of Revenue Chapter 3—State Sales Tax 
PROPOSED RESCISSION 
12 CSR 10-3.142 Trading Stamps. This rule interpreted the sales tax law as it applied to trading stamps and interpreted and applied sections 144.010 and 144.021, RSMo. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it is obsolete because the trading stamps previously covered by this rule are no longer in circulation, and therefore this rule does not provide any useful guidance to taxpayers. 
AUTHORITY: section 144.270, RSMo 1994. This rule was previously filed as rule no. 23 Jan. 22, 1973, effective Feb. 1, 1973. S.T. reg- ulation 010-64 was last filed Dec. 31, 1975, effective Jan. 10, 1976. Refiled March 30, 1976. Amended: Filed Aug. 13, 1980, effective Jan. 1, 1981. Rescinded: Filed Jan. 18, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rescission will not cost state agencies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed rescission will not cost private enti- ties more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed rescission with the Missouri Department of Revenue, General Counsel’s Office, PO Box 475, Jefferson City, MO 65105-0475. To be considered, comments must be received within thirty (30) days after publication of this notice in the Missouri Register. No public hearing is scheduled. 
Title 12—DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE Division 10—Director of Revenue Chapter 3—State Sales Tax 
PROPOSED RESCISSION 
12 CSR 10-3.168 Documentation Required. This rule interpreted the sales tax law as it applied to the documentation required for deductible transactions and interpreted and applied sections 144.030 and 144.080, RSMo. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it has been incor- porated in or superseded by 12 CSR 10-107.100. This rule no longer provides any guidance for taxpayers that is not contained in the more recently promulgated rule. 
AUTHORITY: section 144.270, RSMo 1994. S.T. regulation 010-79 was last filed Dec. 31, 1975, effective Jan. 10, 1976. Refiled March 30, 1976. Amended: Filed Aug. 13, 1980, effective Jan. 1, 1981. Rescinded: Filed Jan. 18, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rescission will not cost state agencies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed rescission will not cost private enti- ties more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate.

12 CSR 10-3.182 Excursions. This rule interpreted the sales tax law as it applied to excursions and interpreted and applied sections 144.010 and 144.020, RSMo.

Air excursions are not subject to tax if the excur- sion takes place in a federal air commerce airspace, and thus each excursion route must be considered individually. Therefore, this rule is no longer valid and may provide inaccurate information to taxpay- ers.

PROPOSED RESCISSION 
12 CSR 10-3.578 Income Tax Returns May be Used. This rule authorized the use of income tax returns for the purpose of determin- ing the amount of sales tax due. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it is obsolete as it has been incorporated in or superseded by 12 CSR 10-101.500. The director may use any information available to make an assessment of tax. Thus, this rule is no longer required. 
AUTHORITY: section 144.270, RSMo 1994. S.T. regulation 330-1 was last filed Dec. 31, 1975, effective Jan. 10, 1976. Refiled March 30, 1976. Amended: Filed Sept. 7, 1984, effective Jan. 12, 1985. Rescinded: Filed Jan. 18, 2018.

Title 12—DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE Division 10—Director of Revenue Chapter 3—State Sales Tax 
PROPOSED RESCISSION 
12 CSR 10-3.579 Estoppel Rule. This rule interpreted the sales tax law as it applied to representations, both oral and written, made by employees of the Department of Revenue and the extent to which tax- payers may rely on these statements. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it is misleadingly titled. The legal theory behind this rule prevents estoppel against the director due to statements of employees. Therefore, the title of this rule is inaccurate and confusing. The information in this rule is pro- vided more clearly in case law and thus is still available to taxpay- ers. 
AUTHORITY: section 144.270, RSMo 1994. Original rule filed Sept.
