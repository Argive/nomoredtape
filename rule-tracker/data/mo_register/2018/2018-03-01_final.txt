Pursuant to section 376.1224, RSMo, regarding the maximum pre- scribed insurance benefit for the coverage of applied behavior analysis for the treatment of autism, the director of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration is required to calculate the new maximum each year to adjust for inflation. 
Using Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers, as required by section 376.1224, RSMo, the new maximum required benefit was established by the following calculations: 
Index Based on 1984 Dollars CPI for 2016: 240.007 CPI for 2017: 245.120 
New ABA Mandated Maximum Benefit = 2017 Limit × (2017 Annual Index/2016 Annual Index) 
$43,826 × (245.120/240.007) = $44,760
