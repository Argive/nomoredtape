 HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO
RULES
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system–
Title Division Chapter Rule
3 CSR 10- 4 .115 Department Code of Agency General area Specific area
State Division regulated regulated Regulations
and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115.
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a.
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation, for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115 NOT Rule 10-4.115. Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated.

 June 15, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 12
Emergency Rules
MISSOURI REGISTER
  Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances.
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable.
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures.
 Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION
Division 2210—State Board of Optometry Chapter 2—General Rules
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT
20 CSR 2210-2.070 Fees. The State Board of Optometry is propos-
ing to add paragraph (1)(C)1.
PURPOSE: The State Board of Optometry is statutorily obligated to enforce and administer the provisions of Chapter 336, RSMo, govern- ing the practice of optometry. Pursuant to section 336.160, RSMo, the board shall set the appropriate amount of fees by rule so that the revenue produced shall not substantially exceed the cost and expense of administering the provisions of Chapter 336, RSMo. Based on the board’s five- (5-) year projections, the board finds it necessary to reduce renewal fees for Missouri licensed optometrists.
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The State Board of Optometry is statu- torily obligated to set all fees, by regulation, necessary to administer the provisions of Chapter 336, RSMo. Pursuant to section 336.160, RSMo, the board shall set the appropriate amount of fees by rule, so that the revenue produced shall not substantially exceed the cost and expense of administering the provisions of Chapter 336, RSMo. Therefore, the board is proposing to decrease 2018 renewal fees for Missouri optometrists from one hundred fifty dollars ($150) to one
hundred twenty-five dollars ($125). Optometrists’ renewal notices will be mailed on August 1, 2018. Without this emergency amend- ment, the decreased fee requirements will not be effective prior to mailing and the board will collect more revenue than it is statutorily authorized to collect. The scope of the emergency amendment is lim- ited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. In developing this emergency amendment, the board has determined that the fee decrease is necessary for the 2018 renew- al period to prevent funds from exceeding the maximum fund balance, thereby resulting in a transfer from the fund to general revenue as set forth in section 336.140.2, RSMo. Pursuant to section 324.001.10, RSMo, a compelling governmental interest is deemed to exist for the purposes of section 536.025, RSMo, for licensure fees to be reduced by emergency rule, if the projected fund balance of any agency assigned to the Division of Professional Registration is reasonably expected to exceed an amount that would require transfer from that fund to general revenue. The board believes this emergency amend- ment to be fair to all interested persons and parties under the circum- stances. This emergency amendment was filed May 11, 2018, becomes effective May 21, 2018, and expires February 28, 2019.
(1) The following fees are established by the State Board of Optometry:
(C) Biennial Renewal Fee $150
1. Effective August 1, 2018 through December 31,
2018 $125
AUTHORITY: sections 336.140 and 336.160, RSMo [Supp. 2007] 2016. This rule originally filed as 4 CSR 210-2.070. Emergency rule filed June 30, 1981, effective July 9, 1981, expired Nov. 11, 1981. Original rule filed June 30, 1981, effective Oct. 12, 1981. For inter- vening history, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Emergency amendment filed May 11, 2018, effective May 21, 2018, expires Feb. 28, 2019. A proposed amendment covering this same material is published in this issue of the Missouri Register.

 MISSOURI Proposed Rules June 15, 2018 REGISTER Vol. 43, No. 12
  Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol-
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms.
If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register.
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking.
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.
 Proposed Amendment Text Reminder:
Boldface text indicates new matter.

(A) A single feasible source exists when[:]—

facturer or a single distributor; or
2. Based on past procurement experience, it is determined that
only one (1) distributor services the region in which the supplies are needed; or
3. Supplies are available at a discount from a single distributor for a limited period of time.
(B) When the Single Feasible Source procurement method is uti- lized, [the division shall use] the following guidelines [to support the Single Feasible Source determination] will be used:
1. The following guidelines may be utilized to determine if sup- plies can be purchased as a single feasible source due to being pro- prietary:
A. The parts are required to maintain validity of a warranty;
B. Additions to a system must be compatible with original equipment;
C. Only one (1) type of computer software exists for a spe- cific application;

3. The following guidelines may be utilized to determine if sup- plies may be purchased as a single feasible source due to being avail- able at a discount for a limited period of time:

days before the contract is to be awarded. Other methods of adver- tisement, however, may be [adopted] used by the division when such other methods are deemed more advantageous for the supplies to be purchased.

Title 10—DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Division 10—Air Conservation Commission Chapter 2—Air Quality Standards and Air Pollution Control Rules Specific to the Kansas City Metropolitan Area
PROPOSED AMENDMENT
10 CSR 10-2.260 Control of Petroleum Liquid Storage, Loading and Transfer. The commission proposes to amend the purpose and sections (1) through (5). If the commission adopts this rule action, the department intends to submit this rule amendment to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to replace the current rule that is in the Missouri State Implementation Plan. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking is available for viewing at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air Pollution Control Program at the address listed in the Notice of Public Hearing at the end of this rule. More information concerning this rulemaking can be found at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Proposed Rules website www.dnr.mo.gov/proposed-rules.
PURPOSE: This amendment removes obsolete provisions, reduces the regulatory burden on facilities, improves consistency with the St. Louis rule 10 CSR 10-5.220 that regulates the same facilities, and clarifies rule language on testing, reporting, and other items. This amendment also complies with Executive Order 17-03 criteria and removes any unnecessary restrictive words, adds back definitions specific to the rule, and adds incorporations by reference as applic- able. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking, per 536.016, RSMo, is Executive Order 17-03 Red Tape Reduction Review and related comments.
PURPOSE: This rule restricts volatile organic compound emissions from the handling of petroleum liquids in three (3) specific areas: petroleum storage tanks with a capacity greater than forty thousand (40,000) gallons, the loading of gasoline into delivery vessels, and the transfer of gasoline from delivery vessels into stationary storage containers. Exemptions are provided for facilities that make transfers
into stationary storage containers of certain sizes and types. This rule is [required in order] necessary to reduce hydrocarbon emissions in the Kansas City metropolitan area that contribute to the formation of ozone.

Title 10—DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Division 10—Air Conservation Commission Chapter 5—Air Quality Standards and Air Pollution Control Rules Specific to the St. Louis Metropolitan Area
10 CSR 10 5.530 Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions From Wood Furniture Manufacturing Operations. The commission proposes to amend the purpose, sections (3)–(4), and subsections (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)D), (2)(A), (2)(E), (2)(M), (2)(X), (2)(AA), (2)(DD), (2)(RR), (5)(A), and (5)(C). If the commission adopts this rule action, the department intends to submit this rule amendment to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to replace the current rule that is in the Missouri State Implementation Plan. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking is available for viewing at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air Pollution Control Program at the address listed in the Notice of Public Hearing at the end of this rule. More information concerning this rulemaking can be found at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Proposed Rules website www.dnr.mo.gov/pro- posed-rules.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this amendment is to remove unnecessary restrictive words, correct test method references, and make minor clarifications and grammatical changes. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking, per 536.016, RSMo, is Executive Order 17-03 Red Tape Reduction review and related comments.
PURPOSE: This rule limits the volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from wood furniture manufacturing operations by incorpo- rating reasonably available control technology (RACT) [as required by] per 172(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act [Amendments (CAAA) of 1990].
(1) Applicability.
(A) This rule [shall apply] applies throughout the City of St.
Louis and St. Charles, St. Louis, Jefferson, and Franklin Counties. (B) This rule is applicable to all existing wood furniture manufac- turing installations that have the potential to emit equal to or greater than twenty-five (25) tons per year of volatile organic compounds
(VOC).
(D) In the event that other rules in Title 10 Division 10 of the Code
of State Regulations are also applicable to wood furniture manufac- turing installations, the more stringent rule [requirement shall apply] applies.
(2) Definitions.
(A) Adhesive—Any chemical substance [that is] applied for [the
purpose of] bonding two (2) surfaces together other than by mechanical means.
(E) Basecoat—A coat of colored material, usually opaque, [that is] applied before graining inks, glazing coats, or other opaque fin- ishing materials and is usually topcoated for protection.
(M) Continuous coater—A finishing system that continuously applies finishing materials onto furniture parts moving along a con- veyor system. Finishing materials that are not transferred to the part are recycled to the finishing material reservoir. Several types of appli- cation methods [can] may be used with a continuous coater includ- ing spraying, curtain coating, roll coating, dip coating, and flow coating.
(X) Finishing material—[A c]Coatings used in the wood furniture industry[. For the wood furniture manufacturing industry, such materials include] including, but [are] not limited to, basecoats, stains, washcoats, sealers, and topcoats.
(AA) Nonpermanent final finish—A material such as a wax, pol- ish, nonoxidizing oil, or similar substance that must be [periodical- ly] reapplied periodically to a surface over its lifetime to maintain or restore the [reapplied] material’s intended effect.
(DD) Organic solvent—A liquid containing volatile organic com- pounds [that is] used for dissolving or dispersing constituents in a coating, adjusting the viscosity of a coating, cleaning, or washoff. When used in a coating, the organic solvent evaporates during drying and does not become a part of the dried film.
PROPOSED AMENDMENT
(RR) Wood furniture component—Any part [that is] used in the

    Page 1278
manufacture of wood furniture. Examples include, but are not limited to, drawer sides, cabinet doors, seat cushions, and laminated tops.
(3) General Provisions.
(A) Restriction of Emissions.

(II) Where sealer is acid-cured alkyd amino vinyl and top-
coat is acid-cured alkyd amino conversion varnish, the VOC contents shall be no more than shown in Table 3;
Note 1: Various numeric values used in inequalities (0.8, 1.8, 1.9, etc.) are maximum allowable VOC contents for various coatings.
Note 2: The 0.9 multiplying factor on the allowable emissions side of the inequality is used to assure that sources using the averaging approach demonstrate [that] their emissions are no greater than ninety percent (90%) of what they would be if they were using com- pliant coatings.
For Inequalities (1) and (2), the facility must use the actual VOC con- tent of the finishing materials used prior to the effective date of this rule if the VOC content is less than the allowable VOC content. For example, if the affected source was using topcoats with a VOC con- tent of 1.7 kilograms of VOC per kilogram of solids (1.7 pounds of VOC per pound of solids) before being subject to this rule, the affect- ed source must use that value in Inequality (2) rather than 1.8.
3. As an alternate to the finishing operation requirements of subparagraph (3)(A)1.A. or part (3)(A)1.B.(II) of this rule, the owner or operator of an affected source may use a control system (capture device/control device) that will achieve an equivalent reduction in emissions as demonstrated using the compliance requirements of subparagraph (3)(C)1.B. of this rule.
4. As an alternate to the finishing operation requirements of paragraphs (3)(A)1. and (3)(A)2. of this rule, the owner or operator of an affected source may use a combination of the methods present- ed in paragraphs (3)(A)1., (3)(A)2., and (3)(A)3. of this rule as demonstrated using the compliance requirements of subparagraph (3)(C)1.C. of this rule.
5. The owner or operator of an affected source shall limit VOC emissions from cleaning operations when using a strippable booth coating[. The VOC contents shall be no more than] to that shown in Table 6.

For this condition, the owner or operator of the affected source shall demonstrate why it is techni- cally or economically infeasible by submitting to the department [a videotape, a technical report or other] documentation to support the affected source’s claim. The support documentation shall include the following criteria, either independently or in combination:
(I) The production speed is too high or the part shape is too complex for one (1) operator to coat the part and the finishing application station is not large enough to accommodate an additional operator; or
(II) The excessively large vertical spray area of the part makes it difficult to avoid sagging or runs in the stain;
8. Line cleaning that pumps or drains all organic solvent used for line cleaning into a normally closed container;
9. Gun cleaning that collects all organic solvent used to clean spray guns into a normally closed container; and
10. Washoff operations that control emissions from washoff operations by—

Title 10—DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Division 10—Air Conservation Commission Chapter 5—Air Quality Standards and Air Pollution Control Rules Specific to the St. Louis Metropolitan Area
PROPOSED AMENDMENT
10 CSR 10-5.540 Control of Emissions From Batch Process Operations. The commission proposes to amend subsections (1)(A)– (1)(E), (4)(A), (4)(C), (5)(A), (5)(C), and (5)(F)–(5)(H), and section (3); renumber existing subsection (2)(J) to (2)(K); renumber and amend existing subsections (4)(G)–(4)(I); add new subsection (2)(J); and delete subsections (2)(K) and (4)(F). If the commission adopts this rule action, the department intends to submit this rule amendment to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to replace the current rule that is in the Missouri State Implementation Plan. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking is available for view- ing at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air Pollution Control Program at the address listed in the Notice of Public Hearing at the end of this rule. More information concerning this rulemaking can be found at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Proposed Rules website www.dnr.mo.gov/proposed-rules.
PURPOSE: This rule limits the volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from batch process operations by incorporating reasonably available control technology (RACT) as required by the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990. The purpose of this rulemaking is to comply with Executive Order 17-03 criteria and will remove the unnecessary use of restrictive words, clarify rule language, update incorporations by reference, and add definitions specific to this rule. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking, per 536.016, RSMo, is Executive Order 17-03 Red Tape Reduction Review and related comments.
(1) Applicability.
(A) This rule [shall apply] applies throughout the City of St.
Louis and St. Charles, St. Louis, Jefferson, and Franklin Counties. (B) This rule [is applicable] applies to all batch process opera- tions that have the potential to emit [equal to or greater than] one hundred (100) tons or more per year of volatile organic compounds (VOC) at [sources] facilities identified by any of the following four (4)-digit standard industrial classification (SIC) codes, as defined in the 1987 edition of the Federal Standard Industrial Classification Manual[: SIC 2821, 2833, 2834, 2861, 2865, 2869, and 2879.], which is hereby incorporated by reference in this rule, as published by the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget. Copies can be obtained from the U.S. Publishing Office Bookstore, 710 N. Capitol Street NW, Washington, DC 20401. This rule does not incorporate any sub-

(C) The following single unit operations and batch process trains
are [subject to this rule but are considered to be de minimis and are, therefore,] exempt from the control requirements of sec- tion (3) of this rule. However, the record keeping and reporting requirements in section (4) of this rule shall apply to such [de min- imis] single unit operations and batch process trains:
1. Within a batch process operation, any single unit operation with uncontrolled total annual mass emissions of less than or equal to five hundred (500) pounds per year (lb/yr) of VOC. [Such] These single unit operations are also excluded from the calculation of the total annual mass emissions for a batch process train. If the uncon- trolled total annual mass emissions from [such] an exempt single unit operation exceed five hundred (500) lb/yr of VOC in any subse- quent year, the [source] owner or operator shall calculate applica- bility in accordance with subsection (1)(E) of this rule for both the individual single unit operation and the batch process train contain- ing the single unit operation; and
2. Any batch process train containing process vents that have, in the aggregate, uncontrolled total annual mass emissions, as deter- mined in accordance with paragraph [(3)(E)1.] (3)(D)1. of this rule, of less than thirty thousand (30,000) lb/yr of VOC for all products manufactured in [such] that batch process train.
(D) The applicability equations in subsection (1)(E) of this rule, which require the calculation of uncontrolled total annual mass emis- sions and flow rate value, shall be used to determine whether a single unit operation or a batch process train is subject to the control requirements in section (3) of this rule. The applicability equations [shall be applied] apply to the following:
1. Any single unit operation with uncontrolled total annual mass emissions that exceed five hundred (500) lb/yr of VOC and [with] a VOC concentration greater than five hundred (500) parts per million by volume (ppmv). In this individual determination, [no] the applic- ability analysis [shall] should not be performed for any single unit operation with a VOC concentration [of] less than or equal to five hundred (500) ppmv; and
2. Any batch process train containing process vents which, in the aggregate, have uncontrolled total annual mass emissions of thir- ty thousand (30,000) lb/yr or more of VOC from all products man- ufactured in the batch process train. Any single unit operation with uncontrolled total annual mass emissions exceeding five hundred (500) lb/yr, regardless of VOC concentration, shall be included in the aggregate applicability analysis.
(E) Applicability Equations. The applicability equations in this rule subsection are specific to volatility.
1. Weighted average volatility (WAV) shall be calculated as fol- lows:
A. For [L]low WAV has a vapor pressure less than or equal to seventy-five (75) millimeters of Mercury (mmHg) at twenty degrees Celsius (20 °C), and shall use the following equation:
FR = [0.07 (UTAME)] - 1,821
Where:
FR =Vent stream flow rate, expressed as standard cubic feet
per minute (scfm);
UTAME =Uncontrolled total annual mass emissions of VOC,
expressed as lb/yr;
B. Moderate WAV has a vapor pressure greater than seventy- five (75) mmHg but less than or equal to one hundred fifty (150) mmHg at twenty degrees Celsius (20 °C), and shall use the following equation:
FR = [0.031 (UTAME)] - 494
C. High WAV has a vapor pressure greater than one hundred fifty (150) mmHg at twenty degrees Celsius (20 °C), and shall use the following equation:
FR = [0.013 (UTAME)] - 301
3. To determine the vapor pressure of VOC, the applicable methods and procedures in section (5) of this rule shall apply.
(2) Definitions.
(J) Volatile organic compound (VOC)—The definition for this term can be found in 10 CSR 10-6.020.
[(J)](K) Volatility—For purposes of this rule, low volatility mate- rials are defined as those which have a vapor pressure less than or equal to seventy-five (75) mmHg at twenty degrees Celsius (20 °C), moderate volatility materials have a vapor pressure greater than sev- enty-five (75) and less than or equal to one hundred fifty (150) mmHg at twenty degrees Celsius (20 °C), and high volatility mate- rials have a vapor pressure greater than one hundred fifty (150) mmHg at twenty degrees Celsius (20 °C). To evaluate VOC volatility for single unit operations that service numerous VOCs or for process- es handling multiple VOCs, the weighted average volatility can be calculated from knowing the total amount of each VOC used in a year, and the individual component vapor pressure, per the equation in paragraph (1)(E)1. of this rule.
[(K) Definitions of certain terms, other than those speci- fied in this rule, may be found in 10 CSR 10-6.020.]
(3) General Provisions.
(A) Every owner or operator of a single unit operation with an
average flow rate, as determined in accordance with paragraph [(3)(E)2.] (3)(D)2. of this rule, below the flow rate value calculated by the applicability equations contained in subsection (1)(E) of this rule, shall reduce uncontrolled VOC emissions from [such] that sin- gle unit operation by an overall efficiency, on an annual average, of at least ninety percent (90%), or twenty (20) ppmv, per batch cycle.
(B) Every owner or operator of a batch process train with an aver- age flow rate, as determined in accordance with subparagraph [(3)(E)2.B.] (3)(D)2.B. of this rule, below the flow rate value calcu- lated by the applicability equations contained in subsection (1)(E) of this rule, shall reduce uncontrolled VOC emissions from [such] that batch process train by an overall efficiency, on an annual average, of at least ninety percent (90%), or twenty (20) ppmv, per batch cycle.

 [(C) Notwithstanding subsection (3)(A) or (3)(B) of this rule, any source that has installed on or before December 15, 1999, any control device which is demonstrated to the department’s satisfaction to be unable to meet the applica- ble control requirements of this rule section, a scrubber, or shell and tube condenser using a non-refrigerated cooling media, and such device achieves at least eighty-one percent (81%) control efficiency of VOC emissions, is required to meet the ninety percent (90%) emission limitation or twenty (20) ppmv VOC concentration in subsection (3)(A) or (3)(B) of this rule, as applicable, upon the earlier to occur of the date the device is replaced for any reason, including, but not limited to, normal maintenance, malfunction, accident, and obsolescence, or May 1, 2002. Control devices installed on or before December 15, 1999, that do not achieve at least eighty-one percent (81%) control efficiency of VOC emis- sions shall comply with the control requirements of subsec- tion (3)(A) or (3)(B) on or before May 1, 2001. A scrubber, shell and tube condenser using a non-refrigerated cooling media, or other control device meeting the criteria of this rule subsection, is considered replaced when—
1. The entire device is replaced; or
2. When either the cost to repair the device or the cost to replace part of the device exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the cost of replacing the entire device with a control device that complies with the ninety percent (90%) emission limi- tation or twenty (20) ppmv VOC concentration level in sub- section (3)(A) of this rule, as applicable.]
[(D)](C) Control Equipment Specifications.
1. If a boiler or process heater is used to comply with this rule
section, the vent stream shall be introduced into the flame zone of the boiler or process heater. The boiler or process heater shall meet the control device requirements for boilers and process heaters included in 40 CFR 60.703, 60.704, and 60.705, as specified in 10 CSR 10-6.030(22).
2. If a flare is used to comply with this rule section, it shall comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 60.18, [which are hereby incorporated by reference] as specified in 10 CSR 10-6.030(22). [The flare operation requirements of 40 CFR 60.18 do not apply i]If a process[,] not subject to this rule[,] vents an emergency relief discharge into a common flare header and causes the flare ser- vicing the process subject to this rule to [not comply with one or more] violate any of the provisions of 40 CFR 60.18, the flare will be temporarily exempt from those provisions. This exemption from flare specification requirements is [a temporary exemption lasting] only [for the period of time] valid during the emergency relief venting discharge.
3. If an afterburner, scrubber, absorber, condenser, or adsorber is used to comply with this rule section, [such] those equipment shall meet the control device requirements [for this equipment] included in 40 CFR 60.703, 60.704, and 60.705, as specified in 10 CSR 10-6.030(22).
4. If an incinerator is used to comply with this rule section, the incinerator shall meet the control device requirements for incinera- tors included in 40 CFR 60.703, 60.704, and 60.705, as specified in 10 CSR 10-6.030(22).
[(E)](D) Determination of uncontrolled total annual mass emis- sions and actual weighted average flow rate values for batch process operations.
1. Uncontrolled total annual mass emissions shall be deter- mined by the following methods:
A. Direct process vent emissions measurements taken prior to any release to the atmosphere, following any recovery device and prior to any control device, provided [such] these measurements conform with the requirements of measuring the mass flow rate of VOC incoming to the control device as in paragraph (5)(F)2. and subparagraphs (5)(F)3.A. and (5)(F)3.B. of this rule; or
from a process vent or process vents, in the aggregate, within a batch process train, using either the potential or permitted number of batch cycles per year or total production as represented in the source’s operating permit.
(I) Engineering estimates of the uncontrolled VOC emis- sions shall be based upon accepted chemical engineering principles, measurable process parameters, or physical or chemical laws and their properties. Examples of methods include, but are not limited to, the following:
(a) Use of material balances based on process stoichiom- etry to estimate maximum VOC concentrations;
(b) Estimation of maximum flow rate based on physical equipment design such as pump or blower capacities; and
(c) Estimation of VOC concentrations based on satura- tion conditions.
(II) All data, assumptions, and procedures used in any engineering estimate shall be documented.
2. Average flow rate shall be determined by any of the following methods:
A. Direct process vent flow rate measurements taken prior to any release to the atmosphere, following any recovery device and prior to any control device, provided such measurements conform with the requirements of measuring incoming volumetric flow rate in paragraph (5)(F)2. of this rule;
B. Average flow rate for a single unit operation having multi- ple emission events or batch process trains shall be the weighted average flow rate, calculated as follows:
n
∑ (AFRi x ADEi) WAF= i=l
n
∑ (ADEi) i=l
where:
WAF =Actual weighted average flow rate for a single unit opera-
tion or batch process train;
AFRi =Average flow rate per emission event; ADEi =Annual duration of emission event; and n =Number of emission events.
For purposes of this formula, the term “emission event” shall be defined as a discrete period of venting that is associated with a single unit operation. For example, a displacement of vapor resulting from the charging of a single unit operation with VOC will result in a dis- crete emission event that will last through the duration of the charge and will have an average flow rate equal to the rate of the charge. The expulsion of expanded vapor space when the single unit operation is heated is also an emission event. Both of these examples of emission events and others may occur in the same single unit operation during the course of the batch cycle. If the flow rate measurement for any emission event is zero, according to paragraph (5)(F)2. of this rule, then such event is not an emission event for purposes of this rule sec- tion; or
C. Engineering estimates calculated in accordance with the requirements in subparagraph (3)(E)1.B. of this rule.
3. For purposes of determining the average flow rate for steam vacuuming systems, the steam flow shall be included in the average flow rate calculation.
4. In cases where two (2) or more single unit operations share a process vent and where flow measurement for such single unit operations is difficult, alternate methods of flow measurement may be used only when approved by the department.
(4) Reporting and Record Keeping.
(A) Every owner or operator of a [de minimis] single unit oper-
ation or batch process train exempt under paragraph (1)(C)1. or

D. As an alternative to subparagraphs (4)(C)3.A., (4)(C)3.B. or (4)(C)3.C. of this rule, at a minimum, records indicating the con- centration level or reading indicated by the VOC monitoring device at the outlet of the scrubber, condenser or carbon adsorber, measured continuously and averaged over the same time period as the perfor- mance test while the vent stream is routed normally.
[(F) Notwithstanding subsections (4)(A) through (4)(E) of this rule, any owner or operator of a batch process operation which uses either a scrubber, shell and tube condenser using nonrefrigerated cooling media, or other control device meet- ing the criteria of subsection (3)(D) of this rule, is required to monitor compliance with the requirements on and after the earlier to occur of the date such device is replaced for any reason or May 1, 2002.]
[(G)](F) The owner or operator of a [de minimis] single unit operation or batch process train exempt from the control require- ments of section (3) of this rule shall notify the department in writing if the uncontrolled total annual mass emissions [from such de min- imis single unit operation or batch process train] exceed the threshold in paragraph (1)(C)1. or (1)(C)2. of this rule, respectively, within sixty (60) days after the event occurs. [Such] This notifica- tion shall include a copy of all records of [such] the event.
[(H)](G) [Every owner or operator of a batch process oper- ation] All records required [to keep records] under this rule sec- tion shall be maintained [such records] on-site for at least five (5) years and [shall make all such records] made available to the department immediately upon request.

using a nonrefrigerated cooling media, or other control device meeting the criteria of subsection (3)(D) of this rule, are required to monitor compliance with the requirements of this rule on and after the earlier to occur of the date such device is replaced for any reason or May 1, 2002.]
(5) Test Methods.
(A) Upon the department’s request, the owner or operator of a
batch process operation shall conduct testing to demonstrate compli- ance with section (3) of this rule. The owner or operator shall, at its own expense, conduct [such] these tests in accordance with the applicable test methods and procedures specified in subsections (5)(D), (5)(E), and (5)(F) of this rule.
(C) When a flare is used to comply with the control requirements of section (3) of this rule, the flare shall comply with the require- ments of 40 CFR 60.18, as specified in 10 CSR 10-6.030(22).
(F) The following methods in 40 CFR 60, Appendix A, [which are hereby incorporated by reference] as specified in 10 CSR 10-6.030(22), shall be used to demonstrate compliance with the reduction efficiency requirement in section (3) of this rule:
1. Method 1 or 1A, as appropriate, for selection of the sampling sites if the flow measuring device is not a rotameter. The control device inlet sampling site for determination of vent stream VOC com- position reduction efficiency shall be prior to the control device and after the control device;
2. Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, 2G or 2H as appropriate, for determination of gas stream volumetric flow rate flow measurements, which shall be taken continuously. No traverse is necessary when the flow measuring device is an ultrasonic probe; and
3. Method 25A or Method 18, if applicable, to determine the concentration of VOC in the control device inlet and outlet, where—
A. The sampling time for each run shall be as follows:
(I) For batch cycles less than eight (8) hours in length, appropriate operating parameters shall be recorded at a minimum of
fifteen (15)-minute intervals during the batched period;
(II) For batch cycles of eight (8) hours and greater in length, the owner or operator may either test in accordance with the test procedures defined in part (5)(F)3.A.(I) of this rule or the owner or operator may elect to perform tests, pursuant to either Method 25A or Method 18, only during those portions of each emission event which profiles a representative sample occurring within the batch cycle. For each emission event of less than four (4) hours in duration, the owner or operator shall test continuously over the entire emission event as in part (5)(F)3.A.(I) of this rule. For each emission event of greater than four (4) hours in duration, the owner or opera- tor shall elect either to perform a minimum of three (3) one-hour test runs during the emission event or shall test continuously over the entire emission event within each single unit operation in the batch process train. The owner or operator shall define the total batch process by all its intrinsic emission events. To demonstrate that the portion of the emission event to be tested profiles a representative sample occurring within the batch cycle, the owner or operator elect- ing to rely on this option shall develop an emission profile for each entire emission event. [Such] These emission profiles shall be based upon either process knowledge or test data collected. Examples of information that could constitute process knowledge include, but are not limited to, calculations based on material balances, duration, emission levels, constituents, reactants, byproducts, and process sto- ichiometry. Previous test results may be used provided [such] the results are still relevant to the current process vent stream conditions;
or
(III) For purposes of paragraph (5)(F)3. of this rule, the term “emission event” [shall be defined as] means a discrete peri- od of venting that is associated with a single unit operation. For example, a displacement of vapor resulting from the charging of a single unit operation with VOC will result in a discrete emission
event that will last through the duration of the charge and will have an average flow rate equal to the rate of the charge. The expulsion of expanded single unit operation vapor space when the vessel is heated is also an emission event. Both of these examples of emission events and others may occur in the same single unit operation during the course of the batch cycle. If the flow rate measurement for any emis- sion event is zero (0), in accordance with paragraph (5)(F)2. of this rule, then [such] this event is not an emission event for purposes of this rule section;
B. Calculate the mass emission rate (MERi) into the control device as follows:
Proposed Rules
where: Ci Qi
MERi = CiQi
=concentration into the control device; and =flow rate into the control device;
C. Calculate the mass emission rate (MERo) out of the con- trol device as follows:
where: Co
Qo
MERo= CoQo
=concentration out of the control device; and =flow rate out of the control device; and
D. Calculate the total overall control device efficiency (η) as follows:
η =(MERi - MERo)/MERi
(G) Upon request by the department to conduct testing, an owner or operator of a batch process operation which has installed a scrub- ber, a shell and tube condenser using a nonrefrigerated cooling media, or any other control device which meets the criteria of sub- section [(3)(D)] (3)(C) of this rule, shall demonstrate that [such] the device achieves the control efficiency applicable within section (3) of this rule [upon the earlier to occur of the date the device is replaced or May 1, 2002].
(H) The owner or operator of a batch process operation may pro- pose an alternative test method or procedures to demonstrate compli- ance with the control requirements in section (3) of this rule. [Such] Alternative methods or procedures [shall be] may only be used after they are approved by the department.

  Title 10—DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Division 10—Air Conservation Commission Chapter 6—Air Quality Standards, Definitions, Sampling and Reference Methods and Air Pollution Control Regulations for the Entire State of Missouri
PROPOSED AMENDMENT
10 CSR 10-6.070 New Source Performance Regulations. The com- mission proposes to amend the rule purpose and sections (1) through (5). If the commission adopts this rule action, the department intends to advise the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that we will accept delegation of enforcement authority for these federal regula- tions. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking is available for viewing at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air Pollution Control Program at the address listed in the Notice of Public Hearing at the end of this rule. More information concerning this rulemaking can be found at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Proposed Rules website www.dnr.mo.gov/pro- posed-rules.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this rulemaking is to comply with Executive Order 17-03 criteria and will remove the unnecessary use of restrictive words. This amendment also incorporates by reference new emission standards, updates, and clarifications to federal rule 40 CFR 60 that were promulgated from January 1, 2013 through March 12, 2018. It also clarifies the rule purpose, removes unneces- sary rule language, clarifies much of the remaining rule language, presents the list of incorporated federal subparts in a more user- friendly format, and makes other clarifying changes. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking, per 536.016, RSMo, is the Title V Operating Permit Program requirements, 40 CFR 70, State/EPA Workplan, and Executive Order 17-03.
PURPOSE: [This rule establishes acceptable design and per- formance criteria for specified new or modified emission sources.] This rule incorporates by reference the new source per- formance standards in 40 CFR 60. This provides the Missouri Department of Natural Resources the authority to implement and enforce these U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations.
(1) Applicability. This rule applies to sources subject to 40 CFR 60 subparts incorporated by reference in subsection (3)(A) of this rule.
[(A) The provisions of 40 CFR 60 promulgated as of June 30, 2012, and Federal Register Notices 77 FR 48433, 77 FR 49490, and 77 FR 56422 promulgated from July 1, 2012, through December 31, 2012, shall apply and are hereby incorporated by reference in this rule, as published by the Office of the Federal Register, U.S. National Archives and Records, 700 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20408.

United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and 4. Incinerators which are subject to Hazardous Waste Management Commission rule 40 CFR 264, subpart O, as incorporated in 10 CSR 25-7.264, shall not be subjected to the requirements of this rule. The exemptions granted under 40 CFR 264.340(b), as incorporated in 10 CSR 25-7.264, are subject to this rule. All other applicable requirements of
this chapter shall remain in effect as to the incinerators.
(C) In addition to complying with the provisions of this rule, affected sources may be required to obtain an operating
permit pursuant to Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments or 10 CSR 10-6.065.
(D) Where emission limitations, test procedure, or other requirements found in both subsection (1)(A) of this rule and in another rule under Title 10 Division 10 of the Code of State Regulations are applicable to an emission source, the more restrictive rule requirement shall be applied.]
(2) Definitions. Certain terms used in 40 CFR [part] 60 refer to fed- eral officers, agencies, and publications. The following terms are substituted when applicable to Missouri [shall be substituted] where appropriate for the [delegable] federal counterparts:

Title 10—DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Division 10—Air Conservation Commission Chapter 6—Air Quality Standards, Definitions, Sampling and Reference Methods and Air Pollution Control Regulations for the Entire State of Missouri
PROPOSED AMENDMENT
10 CSR 10-6.120 Restriction of Emissions of Lead From Specific
Lead Smelter-Refinery Installations. The commission proposes to amend subsections (1)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), (5)(A), (5)(B), and (5)(E). If the commission adopts this rule action, the department intends to submit this rule amendment to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to replace the current rule that is in the Missouri State Implementation Plan. The evidence supporting the need for this pro- posed rulemaking is available for viewing at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air Pollution Control Program at the address listed in the Notice of Public Hearing at the end of this rule. More information concerning this rulemaking can be found at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Proposed Rules website www.dnr.mo.gov/proposed-rules.
PURPOSE: This rule establishes maximum allowable rates of emis- sions of lead from stacks in specific lead-smelter installations, except where New Source Performance Standards apply (as provided in 10 CSR 10-6.070). It also provides for the operation and maintenance of equipment and procedures specific to controlling lead emissions to the ambient air, both from stacks and from the fugitive emissions that escape stack collection systems at these installations. This amend- ment is to comply with Executive Order 17-03 criteria and removes Table 1 because it is no longer necessary due to the shutdown of the facility, updates a federal secondary Maximum Achievable Control Standard, removes any unnecessary restrictive words, and adds incorporations by reference as applicable. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking, per 536.016, RSMo, is Executive Order 17-03 Red Tape Reduction Review and related com- ments.
(1) Applicability.
(A) This rule [shall apply] applies to existing installations in
Missouri engaged in specific smelting and refining for the production of lead.
(3) General Provisions.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT
10 CSR 10-6.161 Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incinerators. The commission proposes to amend subsection (2)(A) and sections (3) and (4). If the commission adopts this rule action, the department intends to submit this rule amendment to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to replace the current rule that is in the Missouri State Plan for Designated Facilities and Pollutants pursuant to section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act for commercial and industrial solid waste incinerators. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking is available for viewing at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air Pollution Control Program at the address listed in the Notice of Public Hearing at the end of this rule. More information concerning this rulemaking can be found at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Proposed Rules web- site www.dnr.mo.gov/proposed-rules.
PURPOSE: This rule incorporates by reference the federal regulatory requirements for existing commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units in Missouri. The purpose of this rulemaking is to update the incorporation by reference date to include recent changes to the federal Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration (CISWI) rule. Recent changes include finalizing definitions for kiln and continuous emissions monitoring system data during startup and shutdown. Also, the particulate matter limit for waste-burning kilns and the emission limits for coal-burning recovery units are finalized. This rulemaking will also remove unnecessary use of restrictive words, update/add incorporations by reference as applicable, and make administrative updates. This rulemaking will also add an optional production-based mercury (Hg) emission limit as an alter- native to the concentration-based Hg emission limit for the waste-
burning kiln subcategory. This rulemaking will assure that state rule requirements remain consistent with the latest federal rule require- ments to avoid confusion. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking, per 536.016, RSMo, is Federal Register 81 FR 40955 dated June 23, 2016, Executive Order 17-03 Red Tape Reduction Review and related comments, and a Central Plains Cement Company variance request dated November 13, 2017, for an alternative production-based Hg limit.

PURPOSE: This rule requires asbestos contractors to register with the department, to notify the department of each asbestos project, to allow the department to inspect asbestos projects, and to pay inspec- tion fees. Each person who intends to perform asbestos projects in Missouri must register annually with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air Pollution Control Program. Any person undertaking a demolition or asbestos project must submit a notifica- tion to the appropriate agency of the department for each asbestos project and each notification must be accompanied by a fee. Asbestos contractors must allow representatives of the department to conduct inspections of projects and must pay inspection fees. The purpose of this rulemaking is to comply with Executive Order 17-03 and related comments and will remove the unnecessary use of restrictive words, add definitions specific to this rule, update incorporated by reference information, and remove the requirement to provide a forty-five (45)- day comment period for revisions to department-supplied forms. This proposed rulemaking will also add conditions for denial of asbestos registration applications, clarifying requirements to receive and keep asbestos registrations, and is consistent with 643.230.1 RSMo. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking, per 536.016, RSMo, is staff comments dated August 23, 2013 and July 11, 2016; and Executive Order 17-03 Red Tape Reduction Review and related comments.

Each person who offers training for asbestos occupations must first obtain accreditation from the depart- ment. Certain business entities who meet the requirements for state- approved exemption status must allow the department to monitor training classes provided to employees who perform asbestos pro- jects. The purpose of this rulemaking is to comply with Executive Order 17-03 and related comments and will remove the unnecessary use of restrictive words, add definitions specific to this rule, update incorporated by reference information, and remove the requirement to provide a forty-five (45)-day comment period for revisions to department-supplied forms. This proposed rulemaking will also add conditions for denial of asbestos occupation certification applica- tions, clarifying requirements to receive and keep asbestos certifica- tions, and is consistent with 643.230.1, RSMo. The evidence sup- porting the need for this proposed rulemaking, per 536.016, RSMo, is staff comments dated August 23, 2013 and July 11, 2016; and Executive Order 17-03 Red Tape Reduction Review and related com- ments.

Q. Actions by the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System or any federal reserve bank to effect monetary or exchange rate policy;
R. Actions that implement a foreign-affairs function of the United States;
S. Actions (or portions thereof) associated with transfers of land, facilities, title, and real properties through an enforceable con- tract or lease agreement where the delivery of the deed is required to occur promptly after a specific, reasonable condition is met, such as promptly after the land is certified as meeting the requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), and where the federal agency does not retain continuing authority to control emissions associated with the lands, facilities, title, or real properties;
T. Transfers of real property, including land, facilities, and related personal property from a federal entity to another federal entity and assignments of real property, including land, facilities, and
related personal property from a federal entity to another federal entity for subsequent deeding to eligible applicants;

V. Air traffic control activities and adopting approach, depar- ture, and enroute procedures for aircraft operations above the mixing height specified in the applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP) or Tribal Implementation Plan (TIP). Where the applicable SIP or TIP does not specify a mixing height, the federal agency can use the three thousand feet (3,000’) above ground level as a default mixing height, unless the agency demonstrates that use of a different mixing height is appropriate because the change in emissions at and above that height caused by the federal action is below the de minimis levels identified in subsection (1)(B) of this rule;
3. Actions where the emissions are not reasonably foreseeable, such as the following:
A. Initial Outer Continental Shelf lease sales which are made on a broad scale and are followed by exploration and development plans on a project level; and
B. Electric power marketing activities that involve the acqui- sition, sale, and transmission of electric energy; and
4. Actions which implement a decision to conduct or carry out a program that has been found to conform to the applicable imple- mentation plan, such as prescribed burning actions which are consis- tent with a land management plan that has been found to conform to the applicable implementation plan.
(K) The provisions of this rule [shall] apply in all nonattainment and maintenance areas except conformity requirements for newly- designated nonattainment areas are not applicable until one (1) year after the effective date of the final nonattainment designation for each National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and pollutant in accordance with section 176(c)(6) of the Act.

the Act.
(D) Area-wide air quality modeling analysis—An assessment
on a scale that includes the entire nonattainment or maintenance area using an air quality dispersion model or photochemical grid model to determine the effects of emissions on air quality; for example, an assessment using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) modeling system.
(E) Cause or contribute to a new violation—A federal action that—
1. Causes a new violation of a national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) at a location in a nonattainment or mainte- nance area which would otherwise not be in violation of the stan- dard during the future period in question if the federal action were not taken; or

 nonattainment or maintenance area in a manner that would increase the frequency or severity of the new violation.
(F) Caused by, as used in the terms direct emissions and indi- rect emissions—Emissions that would not otherwise occur in the absence of the federal action.
(G) Confidential business information—Information that has been determined by a federal agency, in accordance with its applicable regulations, to be a trade secret, or commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential and is exempt from required disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)).
(H) Conformity determination—The evaluation (made after an applicability analysis is completed) that a federal action conforms to the applicable implementation plan and meets the require- ments of this rule.
(I) Conformity evaluation—The entire process from the applic- ability analysis through the conformity determination that is used to demonstrate that the federal action conforms to the requirements of this rule.
(J) Continuous program to implement—The federal agency has started the action identified in the plan and does not stop the actions for more than an eighteen (18)-month period, unless it can demonstrate that such a stoppage was included in the origi- nal plan.
(K) Criteria pollutant or standard—Any pollutants for which there is established a National Ambient Air Quality Standard at 40 CFR 50.
(L) Direct emissions—Those emissions of a criteria pollutant or its precursors that are caused or initiated by the federal action and originate in a nonattainment or maintenance area and occur at the same time and place as the action and are reasonably fore- seeable.
(M) Emergency—A situation where extremely quick action on the part of the federal agencies involved is needed and where the timing of such federal activities makes it impractical to meet the requirements of this rule, such as natural disasters like hurri- canes or earthquakes, civil disturbances such as terrorist acts, and military mobilizations.
(N) Emission inventory—A listing of information on the loca- tion, type of source, type and quantity of pollutant emitted, as well as other parameters of the emissions.
(O) Emissions budgets—Those portions of the total allowable emissions defined in a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency- approved revision to the applicable implementation plan for a certain date for the purpose of meeting reasonable further progress milestones or attainment or maintenance demonstra- tions, for any criteria pollutant or its precursors, specifically allo- cated by the applicable implementation plan to mobile sources, to any stationary source or class of stationary sources, to any fed- eral action or class of action, to any class of area sources, or to any subcategory of the emissions inventory. The allocation system must be specific enough to assure meeting the criteria of section 176(c)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act. An emissions budget may be expressed in terms of an annual period, a daily period, or other period established in the applicable implementation plan.
(P) Offsets (Emission offsets)—Emission reductions which are quantifiable, consistent with the attainment and reasonable fur- ther progress demonstrations of the applicable implementation plan, surplus to reductions required by, and credited to, other applicable implementation plan provisions, enforceable under both state and federal law, and permanent within the time frame specified by the program.
(Q) Federal action—Any activity engaged in by a department, agency, or instrumentality of the federal government, or any activity that a department, agency, or instrumentality of the fed- eral government supports in any way, provides financial assis- tance for, licenses, permits, or approves, other than activities related to transportation plans, programs, and projects devel-
oped, funded, or approved under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (49 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).

C. Emissions related to employee commutation and simi- lar programs to increase average vehicle occupancy imposed on all employers of a certain size in the locality; or
D. Emissions related to the use of federal facilities under lease or temporary permit. For the purposes of this definition, even if a federal licensing, rulemaking, or other approving action is a required initial step for a subsequent activity that causes emissions, such initial steps do not mean that a federal agency can practically control any resulting emissions.
(U) Local air quality modeling analysis—An assessment of localized impacts on a scale smaller than the entire nonattain- ment or maintenance area, including, for example, congested roadways on a federal facility, which uses an air quality disper- sion model (e.g., Industrial Source Complex Model or Emission and Dispersion Model System) to determine the effects of emis- sions on air quality.
(V) Maintenance area—An area that was designated as nonat- tainment and has been re-designated in 40 CFR 81 to attainment, meeting the provisions of section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act and has a maintenance plan approved under section 175A of the Act.

unless both the state and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determine that it is not a significant precursor; and
C. VOC and ammonia (NH3) only in PM2.5 nonattainment or maintenance areas where either the state or EPA determines that they are significant precursors.
(EE) Reasonably foreseeable emissions—Projected future direct and indirect emissions that are identified at the time the conformity determination is made; the location of such emissions is known and the emissions are quantifiable, as described and documented by the federal agency based on its own information and after reviewing any information presented to the federal agency.
(FF) Regional water or wastewater projects—Include construc- tion, operation, and maintenance of water or wastewater con- veyances, water or wastewater treatment facilities, and water storage reservoirs which affect a large portion of a nonattainment or maintenance area.
(GG) Restricted information—Information that is privileged or that is otherwise protected from disclosure pursuant to applica- ble statutes, executive orders, or regulations. Such information includes, but is not limited to, classified national security infor- mation, protected critical infrastructure information, sensitive security information, and proprietary business information.
(HH) Total of direct and indirect emissions—The sum of direct and indirect emissions increases and decreases caused by the fed- eral action; that is, the net emissions considering all direct and indirect emissions. Any emissions decreases used to reduce such total shall have already occurred or shall be enforceable under state and federal law. The portion of emissions which are exempt or presumed to conform under subsection (3)(C), (D), (E), or (F) of this rule are not included in the total of direct and indirect emissions, except as provided in subsection (3)(J) of this rule. The total of direct and indirect emissions includes emissions of crite- ria pollutants and emissions of precursors of criteria pollutants. The segmentation of projects for conformity analyses when emis- sions are reasonably foreseeable is not permitted by this rule.

(JJ) Definitions of certain terms not otherwise described or defined in this rule may be found in 10 CSR 10-6.020.
(3) General Provisions. (A) Prohibition.
1. No department, agency, or instrumentality of the federal gov- ernment [shall] may engage in, support in any way, or provide finan- cial assistance for, license or permit, or approve any activity which
does not conform to an applicable implementation plan.
2. A federal agency must make a determination that a federal action conforms to the applicable implementation plan in accordance
with the requirements of this rule before the action is taken.
3. Notwithstanding any provision of this rule, a determination that an action is in conformity with the applicable implementation plan does not exempt the action from any other requirements of the applicable implementation plan, the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA), or the CAA.
4. If an action would result in emissions originating in more
than one (1) nonattainment or maintenance area, the conformity must be evaluated for each area separately.
(E) Criteria for Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions.
1. An action required under section (1) of this rule, to have a conformity determination for a specific pollutant, will be determined to conform to the applicable implementation plan if, for each pollu- tant that exceeds the rates in subsection (1)(B) of this rule, or other- wise requires a conformity determination due to the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action, the action meets the require- ments of paragraph (3)(E)3. of this rule, and meets any of the follow- ing requirements:
A. For any criteria pollutant or precursor, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action are specifically identified and accounted for in the applicable SIP attainment or maintenance demonstration or reasonable further progress milestone or in a facil- ity-wide emission budget included in a SIP in accordance with sub- section (3)(H) of this rule;
B. For precursors of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, or particulate matter (PM), the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action are fully offset within the same nonattainment or maintenance area (or nearby area of equal or higher classification provided the emissions from that area contribute to the violations, or have con- tributed to violations in the past, in the area with the federal action) through a revision to the applicable SIP or a similarly-enforceable measure that effects emission reductions so that there is no net increase in emissions of that pollutant;
C. For any directly-emitted criteria pollutant, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action meet the require- ments—
(I) Specified in paragraph (3)(E)2. of this rule, based on area-wide air quality modeling analysis and local air quality model- ing analysis; or
(II) Specified in subparagraph (3)(E)1.E. of this rule and, for local air quality modeling analysis, the requirement of paragraph (3)(E)2. of this rule;
D. For carbon monoxide or directly emitted PM—
(I) Where the department determines that an area-wide air quality modeling analysis is not needed, the total of direct and indi- rect emissions from the action meet the requirements specified in paragraph (3)(E)2. of this rule, based on local air quality modeling
analysis; or
(II) Where the department determines that an area-wide air
quality modeling analysis is appropriate and that a local air quality modeling analysis is not needed, the total of direct and indirect emis- sions from the action meet the requirements specified in paragraph (3)(E)2. of this rule, based on area-wide modeling, or meet the requirements of subparagraph (3)(E)1.E. of this rule; or
E. For ozone or nitrogen dioxide, and for purposes of parts (3)(E)1.C.(II) and (3)(E)1.D.(II) of this rule, each portion of the action or the action as a whole meets any of the following require- ments:
(I) Where EPA has approved a revision to the applicable implementation plan after the area was designated as nonattainment and the state or tribe makes a determination as provided in subpart (3)(E)1.E.(I)(a) of this rule or where the state or tribe makes a com- mitment as provided in subpart (3)(E)1.E.(I)(b) of this rule.
(a) The total of direct and indirect emissions from the

    Page 1324
Proposed Rules

 action (or portion thereof) is determined and documented by the department to result in a level of emissions which, together with all other emissions in the nonattainment (or maintenance) area, would not exceed the emissions budgets specified in the applicable SIP.
(b) The total of direct and indirect emissions from the action (or portion thereof) is determined by the department to result in a level of emissions which, together with all other emissions in the nonattainment (or maintenance) area, would exceed an emissions budget specified in the applicable implementation plan and the department makes a written commitment to EPA which includes the following:
I. A specific schedule for adoption and submittal of a revision to the applicable implementation plan which would achieve the needed emission reductions prior to the time emissions from the federal action would occur;
II. Identification of specific measures for incorpora- tion into the applicable implementation plan which would result in a level of emissions which, together with all other emissions in the nonattainment or maintenance area, would not exceed any emissions budget specified in the applicable implementation plan;
III. A demonstration that all existing applicable implementation plan requirements are being implemented in the area for the pollutants affected by the federal action, and that local author- ity to implement additional requirements has been fully pursued;
IV. A determination that the responsible federal agen- cies have required all reasonable mitigation measures associated with their action; and
V. Written documentation including all air quality analyses supporting the conformity determination.
(c) Where a federal agency made a conformity determi- nation based on a state’s or tribe’s commitment under subpart (3)(E)1.E.(I)(b) of this rule and the state has submitted a SIP or TIP to EPA covering the time period during which the emissions will occur or is scheduled to submit such a SIP or TIP within eighteen (18) months of the conformity determination, the state commitment is automatically deemed a call for a SIP or TIP revision by EPA under section 110(k)(5) of the CAA, effective on the date of the fed- eral conformity determination and requiring response within eighteen (18) months or any shorter time within which the state or tribe com- mits to revise the applicable SIP;
(d) Where a federal agency made a conformity determi- nation based on a state or tribal commitment under subpart (3)(E)1.E.(I)(b) of this rule and the state or tribe has not submitted a SIP covering the time period when the emissions will occur or is not scheduled to submit such a SIP within eighteen (18) months of the conformity determination, the state or tribe must, within eighteen (18) months, submit to EPA a revision to the existing SIP committing to include the emissions in the future SIP revision;
(II) The action (or portion thereof), as determined by the MPO, is specifically included in a current transportation plan and transportation improvement program which have been found to con- form to the applicable implementation plan under [10 CSR 10- 2.390 or] 10 CSR 10-5.480;
(III) The action (or portion thereof) fully offsets its emis- sions within the same nonattainment or maintenance area (or nearby area of equal or higher classification provided the emissions from that area contribute to the violations, or have contributed to viola- tions in the past, in the area with the federal action) through a revi- sion to the applicable SIP or an equally-enforceable measure that effects emission reductions equal to or greater than the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action so that there is no net increase in emissions of that pollutant;
(IV) Where EPA has not approved a revision to the relevant SIP since the area was designated or reclassified, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action for the future years (described in paragraph (3)(F)4. of this rule) do not increase emissions with respect to the baseline emissions, and—
(a) The baseline emissions reflect the historical activity
levels that occurred in the geographic area affected by the proposed federal action during—
I. The most current calendar year with a complete emission inventory available before an area is designated unless EPA sets another year;
II. The emission budget in the applicable SIP; or
III. The year of the baseline inventory in the PM10 applicable SIP; and
(b) The baseline emissions are the total of direct and indirect emissions calculated for the future years (described in para- graph (3)(F)4. of this rule) using the historic activity levels (described in subpart (3)(E)1.E.(IV)(a) of this rule) and appropriate emission factors for the future years; or
(V) Where the action involves regional water or wastewater projects, such projects are sized to meet only the needs of population projections that are in the applicable SIP.
2. The area-wide and local air quality modeling analyses must— A. Meet the requirements in subsection (3)(F) of this rule;
and
B. Show that the action does not—
(I) Cause or contribute to any new violation of any stan- dard in any area; or
(II) Increase the frequency or severity of any existing vio- lation of any standard in any area.
3. Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, an action subject to this rule [may] will not be determined to conform to the applicable implementation plan unless the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action is in compliance or consistent with all relevant requirements and milestones contained in the applicable implementation plan, such as elements identified as part of the rea- sonable further progress schedules, assumptions specified in the attainment or maintenance demonstration, prohibitions, numerical emission limits, and work practice requirements, and such action is otherwise in compliance with all relevant requirements of the applic- able implementation plan.
4. Any analyses [required] conducted under this section must be completed, and any mitigation requirements necessary for a find- ing of conformity must be identified before the determination of con- formity is made.
(F) Procedures for Conformity Determinations of General Federal Actions.
1. The analyses [required] conducted under this rule must be based on the latest planning assumptions.
A. All planning assumptions must be derived from the esti- mates of current and future population, employment, travel, and con- gestion most recently developed by the MPO or other agency autho- rized to make such estimates, where available.
B. Any revisions to these estimates used as part of the con- formity determination, including projected shifts in geographic loca- tion or level of population, employment, travel, and congestion, must be approved by the MPO or other agency authorized to make such estimates for the area.
2. The analyses [required] conducted under this rule must be based on the latest and most accurate emission estimation techniques available as described below, unless such techniques are inappropri- ate, the federal agency may obtain written approval from the appro- priate EPA regional administrator for a modification or substitution, of another technique on a case-by-case basis or, where appropriate, on a generic basis for a specific federal agency program.
A. For motor vehicle emissions, the most current version of the motor vehicle emissions model specified by EPA and made avail- able for use in the preparation or revision of SIPs in the state must be used for the conformity analysis as specified below—
(I) The EPA must publish in the Federal Register a notice of availability of any new motor vehicle emissions model; and
(II) A grace period of three (3) months [shall apply] applies during which the motor vehicle emissions model previously specified by EPA as the most current version may be used unless EPA

  June 15, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 12
  Missouri Register
Page 1325
  announces a longer grace period in the Federal Register. Conformity analyses for which the analysis was begun during the grace period or no more than three (3) years before the Federal Register notice of availability of the latest emission model may continue to use the pre- vious version of the model specified by EPA.
B. For non-motor vehicle sources, including stationary and area source emissions, the latest emission factors specified by EPA in the “Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors” (AP-42, http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chiefs/efpac) must be used for the conformi- ty analysis unless more accurate emission data are available, such as actual stack test data from stationary sources which are part of the conformity analysis.
3. The air quality modeling analyses [required] conducted under this rule must be based on the applicable air quality models, databases, and other requirements specified in the most recent ver- sion of the “Guideline on Air Quality Models” (40 CFR 51, Appendix W), unless—
A. The guideline techniques are inappropriate, in which case the model may be modified or another model substituted on a case- by-case basis or, where appropriate, on a generic basis for a specific federal agency program; and
B. Written approval of the EPA regional administrator is obtained for any modification or substitution.
4. The analyses [required] conducted under this rule must be based on the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action and must reflect emission scenarios that are expected to occur under each of the following cases:
A. The attainment year specified in the SIP or, if the SIP does not specify an attainment year, the latest attainment year possible under the Act;
B. The last year for which emissions are projected in the maintenance plan;
C. The year during which the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action is expected to be the greatest on an annual basis; and
D. Any year for which the applicable SIP specifies an emis- sions budget.
(I) Emissions Beyond the Time Period Covered by the SIP. If a federal action would result in total direct and indirect emissions above the applicable thresholds which would be emitted beyond the time period covered by the SIP, the federal agency can—
1. Demonstrate conformity with the last emission budget in the SIP; or
2. Request the state or tribe to adopt an emissions budget for the action for inclusion in the SIP. The state or tribe must submit a SIP or TIP revision to EPA within eighteen (18) months either including the emissions in the existing SIP or establishing an enforceable com- mitment to include the emissions in future SIP revisions based on the latest planning assumptions at the time of the SIP revision. No such commitment by a state or tribe [shall] may restrict a state’s or tribe’s ability to require Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM), or any other con- trol measures within the state’s or tribe’s authority to ensure timely attainment of the NAAQS.
(J) Timing of Offsets and Mitigation Measures.
1. The emissions reductions from an offset or mitigation mea-
sure used to demonstrate conformity must occur during the same cal- endar year as the emission increases from the action except as pro- vided in paragraph (3)(J)2. of this rule.
2. The state or tribe may approve emissions reductions in other years provided—
A. The reductions are greater than the emission increases by the following ratios:
B. The time period for completing the emissions reductions [must] cannot exceed twice the period of the emissions; and
C. The offset or mitigation measure with emissions reduc- tions in another year will not—
(I) Cause or contribute to a new violation of any air quality standard;
(II) Increase the frequency or severity of any existing vio- lation of any air quality standard; or
(III) Delay the timely attainment of any standard or any interim emissions reductions or other milestones in any area.
3. The approval by the state or tribe of an offset or mitigation measure with emissions reductions in another year does not relieve the state or tribe of any obligation to meet any SIP or CAA milestone or deadline. The approval of an alternate schedule for mitigation measures is at the discretion of the state or tribe, and [they] are [not required] under no obligation to approve an alternate schedule.
(L) Early Emission Reduction Credit Programs at Federal Facilities and Installations Subject to Federal Oversight.
1. Federal facilities and installations subject to federal oversight can, with the approval of the state or tribal agency responsible for the SIP or TIP in that area, create an early emissions reductions credit program. The federal agency can create the emission reduction cred- its in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (3)(L)2. of this rule and can use them in accordance with paragraph (3)(L)3. of this rule.
2. Creation of emission reduction credits.
A. Emissions reductions must be quantifiable through the use
of standard emission factors or measurement techniques. If non-stan- dard factors or techniques to quantify the emissions reductions are used, the federal agency must receive approval from the state or trib- al agency responsible for the implementation of the SIP or TIP and from EPA’s regional office. The emission reduction credits do not have to be quantified before the reduction strategy is implemented but must be quantified before the credits are used in the general con- formity evaluation.
B. The emission reduction methods must be consistent with the applicable SIP or TIP attainment and reasonable further progress demonstrations.
C. The emissions reductions cannot be required by or credit- ed to other applicable SIP or TIP provisions.
D. Both the state or tribe and federal air quality agencies must be able to take legal action to ensure continued implementation of the emission reduction strategy. In addition, private citizens must also be able to initiate action to ensure compliance with the control requirement.
E. The emissions reductions must be permanent or [the] have a specific time frame for the reductions [must be specified]. F. The federal agency must document the emissions reduc- tions and provide a copy of the document to the state or tribal air quality agency and the EPA regional office for review. The documen- tation must include a detailed description of the emission reduction strategy and a discussion of how it meets the requirements of sub-
paragraphs (3)(L)2.A. through (3)(L)2.E. of this rule.
3. Use of emission reduction credits. The emission reduction credits created in accordance with paragraph (3)(L)2. of this rule can be used, subject to the following limitations, to reduce the emissions increase from a federal action at the facility for the conformity eval-
uation.
A. If the technique used to create the emission reduction is
implemented at the same facility as the federal action and could have occurred in conjunction with the federal action, then the credits can be used to reduce the total direct and indirect emissions used to determine the applicability of the regulation [as required in] under section (1) of this rule and as offsets or mitigation measures [required by] under subsection (3)(E) of this rule.
B. If the technique used to create the emission reduction is not implemented at the same facility as the federal action or could not have occurred in conjunction with the federal action, then the
(I) Extreme nonattainment areas (II) Severe nonattainment areas (III) Serious nonattainment areas (IV) Moderate nonattainment areas (V) All other areas

12 CSR 10-23.275 Recognition of Nonresident Disabled Person Windshield Placards. This rule set forth the criteria by which Missouri recognized and honored vehicles displaying disabled person windshield placards or disabled emblems issued to resident or non- resident operators of these vehicles by the United States government, another state, District of Columbia, or territory or possession of the United States.
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it is unnecessary and the department lacks rulemaking authority as required by section 536.014, RSMo. Section 301.271, RSMo specifically provides that Missouri recognizes out of state registrations.
AUTHORITY: sections 301.142, RSMo Supp. 2001 and 301.271, RSMo 2000. Original rule filed April 21, 1986, effective Aug. 11, 1986. Amended: Filed Nov. 12, 1991, effective March 9, 1992. Amended: Filed Sept. 27, 2001, effective March 30, 2002. Rescinded: Filed May 9, 2018.

PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it is unnecessary. Sections 301.442 and 301.140, RSMo address the continued use of previously issued license plates after a transfer. The examples provid- ed in the rule are overly complicated and unnecessary.
AUTHORITY: sections 301.140, RSMo Supp. 1987 and 301.442, RSMo 1986. Original rule filed April 21, 1986, effective Aug. 11, 1986. Rescinded: Filed May 9, 2018.

PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it is unnecessary. Section 301.390, RSMo already describes the procedure for the issuance of a special identification number to property seized by law enforcement.
AUTHORITY: section 301.390, RSMo 1986. Original rule filed April 23, 1992, effective Dec. 3, 1992. Rescinded: Filed May 9 2018.

This rule pro- vided clarification of procedures to be followed for the expungement from a Missouri driver record of previously recorded traffic viola- tions or suspensions or revocations of a driving privilege.
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it lacks substantive value and the department lacks rulemaking authority as required by section 536.014, RSMo. This rule provided the department with per- missive authority to delete certain traffic convictions from a Missouri driving record. The department is required to maintain copies of all accident reports, applications for licenses, and abstracts of court

 convictions pursuant to section 302.120, RSMo. The department’s authority in this area is also addressed in relationship to the expungement of criminal records, sections 610.122 through 610.140, RSMo. Specifically, section 610.126 permits the department to keep records necessary for administrative actions on a driver’s license.
AUTHORITY: sections 302.286, 302.304, 302.309 and 303.041, RSMo Supp. 2004, and 49 CFR 384.231(d). Original rule filed May 27, 1986, effective Aug. 25, 1986. For intervening history, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Rescinded: Filed May 9, 2018.

Title 12—DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE Division 10—Director of Revenue Chapter 26—Dealer Licensure
PROPOSED RESCISSION
12 CSR 10-26.200 Out-of-State Dealer Request to Participate in Missouri Recreational Vehicle Show or Exhibit. Section 301.566, RSMo, required a recreational vehicle (RV) dealer licensed in anoth- er state who intends to participate in a RV show or exhibition in Missouri to notify the Department of Revenue at least thirty (30) days prior to the event. This rule established the form that must be used to notify the department.
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because the provisions of (1) and (1)(B) within the rule are already stated in section 301.566.3, 4, and 5. The form referenced in the provisions of (1)(A) within the rule is not required, therefore the entire rule is unnecessary.
AUTHORITY: sections 301.553, RSMo 2000 and 301.566, RSMo Supp. 2007. Original rule filed Aug. 8, 2007, effective Feb. 29, 2008. Rescinded: Filed May 9, 2018.
