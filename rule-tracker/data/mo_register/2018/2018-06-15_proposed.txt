Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.] 
Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 90—Weights, [and] Measures and Consumer Protection Chapter 1—Organization and Description 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
2 CSR 90-1.010 General Organization. Pursuant to HB28 The Land Survey Program was moved from Department of Natural Resources to Department of Agriculture in August 2013. This divi- sion is amending the division title, purpose, sections (1) and (2), deleting section (3), and adding a new section (3). 
PURPOSE: This amended rule adds the Land Survey Program, for- merly residing in the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, to the division’s general organization and description. The rule is delet- ing old section (3) because the division no longer uses many paper forms. 
PURPOSE: This rule complies with section 536.023, RSMo [(1986)] which requires each agency to adopt as a rule a descrip- tion of its operation and the method where the public may obtain information or make submissions or requests. 
PUBLISHER’S NOTE: The secretary of state has determined that the publication of the entire text of the material which is incorporated by reference as a portion of this rule would be unduly cumbersome or expensive. This material as incorporated by reference in this rule shall be maintained by the agency at its headquarters and shall be made available to the public for inspection and copying at no more than the actual cost of reproduction. This note applies only to the ref- erence material. The entire text of the rule is printed here. 
(1) The Division of Weights, [and] Measures and Consumer Protection is a unit of the Department of Agriculture, state of Missouri.

Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 90—Weights, Measures and Consumer Protection Chapter 60—Missouri Standards for Property Boundary 
Surveys 
PROPOSED RULE 2 CSR 90-60.010 Application of Standards 
PURPOSE: These standards provide the professional land surveyor and recipient of boundary surveys with a realistic guideline for ade- quate survey performance. This rule describes the types of surveys to which these standards apply. 
The standards in this chapter apply to all property boundary surveys made for determining the location of land boundaries and land boundary corners, but do not apply to preliminary plats or plans, plot plans, design surveys, geodetic surveys, or cartographic surveys. Any individual or corporation licensed with the board to perform land surveying services in this state shall be familiar with and comply with these standards. The Missouri Standards for Property Boundary Surveys are not intended to be used in place of professional land surveying judgment. There may be special cir- cumstances and conditions that make it impractical to comply with some provisions of the standards. If the survey deviates from these standards, this deviation shall be noted, described, and justified on the plat of survey by the professional land surveyor. This provision cannot be used to intentionally circumvent the basic tenets of these standards. 
AUTHORITY: sections 60.510(7), 60.550, and 448.2-109, RSMo 2016. Material in this rule was originally covered in 10 CSR 30- 2.010. Original rule filed Dec. 1, 2016. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rule will not cost state agencies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed rule will not cost private entities more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed rule with Missouri Department of Agriculture, Weights, Measures and Consumer Protection Division, Mr. Ronald G. Hayes, Division Director, PO Box 630, Jefferson City, MO 65102. Hand carried copies may be delivered to the Missouri Department of Agriculture, Weights, Measures and Consumer Protection Division, Mr. Ronald G. Hayes, Division Director, 1616 Missouri Blvd., Jefferson City, MO 65109. To be considered, comments must be received within thirty (30) days after publication of this notice in the Missouri Register.

Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 90—Weights, Measures and Consumer Protection Chapter 60—Missouri Standards for Property Boundary Surveys 
PROPOSED RULE 2 CSR 90-60.020 Definitions 
PURPOSE: This rule defines the various technical and legal terms used in this chapter. 
(1) Condominium Survey—A property boundary survey that cre- ates and defines condominium property in accordance with Chapter 448, RSMo. 
(2) Controlling Corners—Those corners that determine the location of the exterior corners of the surveyed boundary. 
(3) Exterior Corners—Corners that define the shape and size of the parcel. 
(4) Material Variations—The differences between surveyed lines and lines of possession or measurements called for in the record source of the property being surveyed that are, in the professional judgment of the professional land surveyor, significant enough to warrant par- ticular notice. 
(5) Original Survey—A survey which creates a new parcel, or parcels, out of a larger parent tract. 
(6) Physical Monument—Natural or artificial objects which are accepted and used to mark boundaries and corners. 
(7) Positional Uncertainty—The positive and negative range of values expected for a computed horizontal position as a result of random errors. 
(8) Property Boundary Survey—Any survey that creates, defines, marks, remarks, retraces, or reestablishes the boundaries of parcels of real property or the subdivision of lands. 
(9) Property Description—A description of the limits of real prop- erty by recitation of metes and bounds or by an aliquot part of the United States Public Land Survey System or by lot or parcel desig- nation referenced to a subdivision, survey, or other document recorded in the public records. 
(10) Random Errors—Unavoidable errors in measurement that are caused by the inability of the operator to make exact measure- ments. (Random errors generally follow statistical principles and can be reduced with care in measurement, but can never be com- pletely eliminated).

PROPOSED RULE 2 CSR 90-60.030 General Land Surveying Requirements 
PURPOSE: This rule sets forth standards that apply to all property boundary surveys. 
(1) Records Research. (A) Every survey executed shall be based on the property 
description of the parcel or parent tract taken from the public records; and 
(B) Prior to performing the fieldwork, the professional land sur- veyor shall acquire sufficient data to ascertain the record title boundary of the parcel(s) to be surveyed (such as: adjoining deeds, maps, right of way plans, subdivision plats, original plats and notes, and subsequent surveys). This requirement does not obligate the professional land surveyor to search the entire chain of title. 
(2) Field Investigation. The professional land surveyor or a person under his/her direct personal supervision shall— 
(A) Search thoroughly for monuments and accessories at the nec- essary controlling corners and any other physical evidence that may be required to define the location of the exterior corners of the parcel surveyed (such as: location of streets, roads, lines of occupation, and

parole information); (B) Obtain appropriate and sufficiently redundant measurements 
to correlate all found evidence; (C) Evaluate the reliability of the evidence and monuments 
found and apply the proper theory of location in accordance with surveying precedent; and 
(D) Reach a conclusion on the location of the boundary and set monuments as defined herein. 
(3) Monumentation. (A) The professional land surveyor shall establish semi-perma- 
nent or confirm existing monuments at every exterior corner of the tract being surveyed, except for lines running along streams or lakes where witness monuments must be set along the connected sidelines. When it is impractical to set a monument at a required corner, a witness monument shall be set along a line of the survey or the pro- longation thereof; 
(B) Existing monuments shall be evaluated for permanency by the professional land surveyor. Those needing restoration, preservation, or replacement shall receive the due care necessary to ensure that their permanency is secured in accordance with the requirements set forth herein; 
(C) Additional Monumentation for Subdivision Surveys. 1. In addition to meeting the requirements set forth above, the professional land surveyor shall, prior to the recording of the subdi- vision plat, establish at least two (2) permanent monuments for every four (4) acres of land developed by the subdivision. This requirement is waived if the survey does not create more than four (4) lots or 
parcels. 2. The permanent monuments required in paragraph (3)(C)1. 
shall be set prior to the recording of the plat or if likely to be destroyed by construction, may be installed upon completion of the construction and must be set no later than twelve (12) months after the recording of the plat. The professional land surveyor shall also monument all lot corners in the subdivision with semi-permanent or witness monuments within the same twelve- (12-) month period. 
3. When the subdivision is a cemetery, the requirements of sub- paragraph (3)(C)1. for installation of permanent monuments shall be increased to include four (4) permanent monuments per block and the monumentation of all lot corners required in paragraph (3)(C)2. shall not be required; and 
(D) Condominium surveys shall meet the requirements for subdi- visions. 
(4) Publication of Results: A plat shall be made showing the results of the survey or subdivision and shall conform to all of the follow- ing provisions: 
(A) The plat shall include a drawing that shall be made to a convenient scale on a reasonably permanent and dimensionally sta- ble material; 
(B) The plat shall include the name of the person or entity for whom the survey was made and the date of the survey;

(D) The direction of boundary lines shall be shown by angles, azimuths, or bearings with the directional reference system clearly described on the plat; 
(E) A north arrow, a written scale, and a graphic scale shall be shown on every sheet containing graphic survey data; 
(F) Complete dimensions (distances, directions, and curve data) of all parcels surveyed or created. All linear measurements shall be shown as horizontal distances at the ground surface in feet or meters. Curved lines shall show at least two (2) elements. For non-tangential curves, a directional component shall be included to help define the direction of the curve (preferably the chord bearing); 
(G) All vertical measurements shall be shown as elevations above an established or assumed datum in feet or meters. When elevations 
are shown, a clearly defined elevation datum shall be shown, including the location and elevation of the benchmark used to establish the project datum; 
(H) Measurements and calculated areas will be shown on the plat to a number of significant figures representative of the actual preci- sion of the measurements; 
(I) The plat shall display either a property description for the parcel(s) and/or parent tract surveyed or a reference to the source document from which the property description was taken. Any new parcel created by survey shall have its property description shown on the plat and must be complete enough so that the par- cel can be located and clearly identified. Subdivision plats shall iden- tify all lots for sale by numbers, as set forth in section 445.010, RSMo; 
(J) The plat shall show sufficient data (distances and directions) to positively locate the parcel surveyed within the United States Public Land Survey System (USPLSS), or within the recorded subdivision. If the survey cannot be located by either of the previously mentioned provisions, it must be referenced to other lines and points sufficiently established by record; 
(K) All controlling corner monuments that were found and exteri- or corners that were found or set shall be identified on the plat; 
(L) Any material variation between record and measured dimen- sions; and any material variation and the extent of such variation between surveyed lines and lines of possession at all exterior corners shall be shown on the plat. Material variation will include, but is not limited to, survey monuments, fences, obvious occupation (i.e., mowed) lines, walls, or other structures whether on the property sur- veyed or on adjacent property; 
(M) The plat shall reference the source document(s) for any perti- nent data obtained during the records research provision set forth above. The plat shall also reference the property type (Urban or Rural); 
(N) The identity of the record title documents for adjoining prop- erties, consistent with the records research provision set forth above, shall be shown on the plat, including their record source; 
(O) In addition to the above, all condominium surveys shall show the pertinent information required in section 448.2-109, RSMo, and the legally sufficient descriptions of easements serving or burdening the condominium; and 
(P) The plat shall include a statement that the survey and or sub- division were executed in accordance with the Missouri Standards for Property Boundary Surveys as set forth herein. The statement on a condominium plat shall also include a declaration that the plat con- tains all information required by section 448.2-109, RSMo. 
(5) Deliverables. The professional land surveyor shall furnish to the client a plat containing the drawing and other pertinent information identified above. Each sheet of the plat shall bear the signature and seal of the professional land surveyor in responsible charge. This signed and sealed plat shall be the official plat and shall take prece- dence over any other formatted data that may be delivered to the client or his/her representatives, successors, or assigns.

PROPOSED RULE 2 CSR 90-65.030 Definitions 
PURPOSE: This rule defines the terms as used in this standard. 
(1) Cadastral Data—Source information used to delineate the geo- graphic extent, quantity, and dimensions of cadastral parcels. Source information includes the United States Public Land Survey System (PLSS), subdivision plats, land surveys, real estate conveyances, right-of-way plans, etc. 
(2) Cadastral Parcel Mapping—The delineated identification of all real property parcels. The cadastral map is based upon the United States Public Land Survey System (PLSS). For cadastral parcel maps the position of the legal framework is derived from the PLSS, exist- ing tax maps, and tax database property descriptions, recorded deeds, recorded surveys, and recorded subdivision plats. 
(3) Digital Cadastral Parcel Mapping—Encompasses the concepts of automated mapping, graphic display and output, data analysis, and database management as pertains to cadastral parcel mapping. Digital cadastral parcel mapping systems consist of hardware, soft- ware, data, people, organizations, and institutional arrangements for collecting, storing, analyzing, and disseminating information about the location and areas of parcels and the United States Public Land Survey System. 
(4) Digital Section Vertices—The points on a digital cadastral map that define the PLSS lines and corners. 
(5) Metadata—Information that describes specific details about a dataset. Metadata for geographic information may include the source of the data, its creation date and format, its projection scale, resolu- tion, and accuracy.

Proposed Rules 
January 3, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 1 
(6) Metes and Bounds—Describe the limits of a land parcel by refer- ence to courses and distances around a tract and by reference to nat- ural and artificial monuments of record. 
(7) Missouri State Plane Coordinate System—The system of plane coordinates that have been established by the National Oceanic Survey/National Geodetic Survey, or its successors, for defining and stating the geodetic positions or locations of points on the surface of the earth within the state of Missouri as defined in sections 60.401 through 60.491, RSMo. 
(8) Parcel—A single unit of real property which can be described by location and boundaries and for which there is a history of defined, legally recognized interests. Parcel boundaries are usually described in a conveyance document by aliquot part, metes and bounds, or by lot number in a recorded subdivision. 
(9) Point—A vector map feature having no length and no area, but is simply defined by a coordinate location. 
(10) Polygon—A vector map feature represented by a closed geomet- ric figure. 
(11) Polyline—A vector map feature formed by connecting two (2) points and having no area. 
(12) Tax Map—A document or map for taxation purposes showing the location, quantity, dimensions, and other relevant information pertaining to a parcel of land subject to ad valorem taxes, commonly known as property taxes. 
(13) Topology—The spatial relationships between connecting, or adjacent, geographic features. Topological relationships are for spa- tial modeling operations that do not require coordinate information. 
(14) United States Public Land Survey System (PLSS)—The rectan- gular survey system created by the United States Government found- ed on a principal meridian and base line and forming townships approximately six (6) miles north and south by six (6) miles east and west, which are subdivided into thirty-six (36) sections approximate- ly one (1) mile square. The system, established by surveys executed under the direction of the General Land Office (GLO), and evi- denced by township plats, field notes, and other available documen- tation. This system includes nonconforming private claims and other surveys as may have been performed under the direction of the General Land Office. The Fifth Principal Meridian is the basis of the Missouri PLSS.

In addition, each document that contains confidential information shall bear the designation “Confidential” and the 4 CSR 240-2.135(2)(A) through which that information is protected. 
[(2)](3) Protective Order.

If the party seeking discovery [contin- ues to disagree with the designation placed on the informa- tion, it] exhausts these dispute resolution procedures, that party may file a motion challenging the designation. 
[(C) This rule does not require the disclosure of any infor- mation that would be protected from disclosure by any priv- ilege, rule of the commission, or the Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure.] 
[(4)](6) [Proprietary] Confidential information may be disclosed only to the attorneys of record for a party and to employees of a party who are working as subject-matter experts for those attorneys or who intend to file testimony in that case, or to persons designated by a party as an outside expert in that case.

Monuments [will] shall meet the requirements for a permanent monument in accordance with [10 CSR 30-2.060] the Missouri Standards for Property Boundary Surveys. 
(2) In such cases where the placement of a required corner monu- ment at its proper location is impractical, it shall be permissible to 
set a reference or witness monument or mark near that point, and if such reference monument or mark is set, its location shall be prop- erly shown on the certified land corner document[ation]. 
(3) All monuments shall be marked and designated in accordance with [10 CSR 30-3.060] the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) system of marking monuments that furnishes ready iden- tification of the position of the monument which bears the mark. Letters and numerals should be carefully stamped with three-six- teenths inch (3/16") or one-eighth inch (1/8") steel dies and should always be made to read from the south. Lines and crosses should be made with a sharp, cold chisel. The precise position shall be marked by a point, cross, or appropriate symbol on the mon- ument. 
(4) Where possible, four (4) reference ties (distance and[/or] direc- tion) to durable objects will be made to provide the means for [relo- cating] restoring the position of the marked corner if the monu- ment is disturbed. Durable objects include, but are not restricted to: house corners [(fully describe)], marks on concrete structures or pavement, marks on ledge or bedrock, trees, additional permanent monuments, fence posts, utility poles, and crosses on curbs. All durable objects and reference ties shall be fully described on the document. 
(6) At locations where a stone, iron pin, pipe, or other monument is to be replaced by a permanent monument, the existing monument will be removed and buried or placed alongside the permanent mon- ument[. If there is an “X” or other mark on the old monu- ment, it should be buried facing down or on its side so as] in such a manner that it will not [to] be confused with the perma- nent monument.

Proposed Rules 
January 3, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 1 
PURPOSE: The division is amending this rule to modernize the lan- guage and terms in this rule. 
(1) The following information will be submitted for each control sur- vey that is to be evaluated for inclusion into the Missouri Geographic Reference System (MO GRS) as a first or second order station. 
(C) A north arrow and graphic scale should appear on the sketch. All station symbols should be labeled with the station name. [with an inset used w]When stations are spaced too closely together to be clearly depicted on the network sketch, an inset shall be used. 
(2) A report shall be submitted for each project and shall be signed and sealed by the professional land surveyor or professional engi- neer in responsible charge. The report shall be the main source of information for judging whether or not the stations should be accept- ed as MO GRS stations. It shall be the responsibility of the profes- sional land surveyor or professional engineer to supply sufficient information in the report to facilitate inclusion of the stations in the MO GRS. 
(3) The report shall contain a clear description of the survey proce- dures and equipment used in the field. This includes, but is not lim- ited to, the information entered into the field log and auxiliary infor- mation such as logistics, preanalysis [and], satellite selection results (if Global Positioning System (GPS) survey), personnel involved, and difficulties encountered. 
(5) The following shall be included for GPS surveys. The version number and date of the GPS software used must be reported. For GPS surveys, the professional land surveyor or professional engi- neer must also specifically report the baselines rejected for the pro- ject. All parameters used for any coordinate transformations shall be presented and any scaling of the covariance matrix by the profession- al land surveyor or professional engineer must be described in detail. If the covariance matrix has been scaled, the scale factor used must also be presented. These results must be reported for all single base line and network solutions. Statistical testing of the survey results from the network solution, including analysis of variance fac- tors, semi-major axis of [2-d] two- (2-) dimensional (horizontal) or [3-d] three- (3-) dimensional ninety-five percent (95%) (horizontal and vertical) relative confidence regions between all directly con- nected pairs of [points] stations, residuals and residual outliers shall be provided. In addition, the results of any self-validation checks must be reported[,] including, but not limited to, comparisons of any repeated single base line solutions. 
(6) For traverse surveys, all field data used to determine directions, distances, azimuths, and elevations, as well as the adjustment calcu- lations, shall be submitted along with the name of the software used in the adjustment. The data submitted shall show the final results of the adjustment and the error analysis. 
(7) Only those stations meeting the requirements of [10 CSR 30- 4.030, 10 CSR 30-4.040, 10 CSR 30-4.050 and 10 CSR 30-4.060] 2 CSR 90-62.030, 2 CSR 90-62.040, 2 CSR 90- 62.050, and 2 CSR 90-62.060 will be accepted for publication in the MO GRS.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
[10 CSR 30-4.050] 2 CSR 90-62.050 GPS Survey Guidelines. The division is moving the rule and amending sections (1), (2), (3), (4), (9), (10), (11), and (15). 
PURPOSE: The division is amending this rule to modernize the lan- guage and terms in this rule. 
(1) Direct connections must be made to any adjacent observable National [Geographic] Spatial Reference System [(NGRS)] (NSRS) and/or Missouri Geographic Reference System (MO GRS) station located five kilometers (5 km) or less from any new station. 
(2) At least three (3) existing higher or equal order control points must be included in any proposed Global Positioning System (GPS) survey. Whenever possible these should be three (3) [3-d] three- (3-) dimen- sional control [points] stations. Otherwise two (2) sets of three (3) [points] stations, (three (3) [2-d] two- (2-) dimensional horizontal [points] stations and three (3) vertical control [points] stations) must be used. These control [points] stations should be chosen to be roughly equidistant on the periphery of the [network] proposed project so that they enclose as much of the [proposed network] project as possible. 
(3) Each new [point] station to be established by the proposed GPS survey must be occupied at least two (2) separate times to enable prop- er checking of blunders (for example, incorrect point, setup errors, incorrect antenna heights). A separate occupation is one [where] in which the antenna [has] and its supporting device (tripod) have been taken down and set up again and the receiver restarted. 
(4) Each [point] station must be connected by simultaneous occupa- tions [(that is, base line)] (baselines) to at least three (3) other [points] stations in the network after outlier [base lines] baselines have been rejected from the adjustment. Because it is generally easier to resolve the integer phase ambiguities over shorter base line, adja- cent [points] stations should be connected wherever possible. 
(8) A detailed field log must be kept during observation taken at each station. At the very least the following information must be recorded: 
 
January 3, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 1 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 29 

(A) Universal Time [Correction] Coordinated (UTC) date of observations; 
(F) Antenna height and offset from monument, if any, to one mil- limeter (1 mm). Note should be made [of any deviation from standard method of measuring HI] as to whether the height is measured as a slant height or vertical height; 
(K) Completed field log data forms for each station occupation will be submitted either using those provided by the Missouri Department of [Natural Resources (DNR)] Agriculture (MDA) or some other type containing all necessary information [found] included on the [DNR] MDA forms. 
(9) The raw data files for all station occupations must be submitted. Each file[, called an R-file,] will consist of one (1) set of raw obser- vations for each station occupation session. For example, four (4) receivers operating during each of five (5) sessions will produce twenty (20) [R-files] raw data files. [An example of a raw data file would be the DAT, ION, MES, and EPH files produced by a Trimble receiver during a station occupation.] 
(10) The unadjusted [base line] baseline vector solution files for all observed [base lines] baselines, non-trivial and trivial, will be sub- mitted. [These files are produced by post-processing soft- ware such as the OPT or FIX, FLT, and TRP files produced by Trimvec post-processing software.] 
(11) If station description information is not provided by [DNR] MDA, it must be submitted for each station occupied. Station descriptions must include station name, county, township, range, sec- tion, United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5[‘]-minute quad- rangle name, date monumented, date of observations, complete descriptions of the station, azimuth and all reference monuments, a current “to reach” description, and any special information such as property owner name, address, and phone number. A sketch depict- ing the station and reference marks with dimensions and directions shown should accompany all narrative data. Examples of complete station description information may be obtained from [DNR] MDA. 
(15) A minimally constrained (free) least squares, three- (3-) dimen- sional [(3-d)] adjustment will be submitted in the form of the input and output files.

Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2030—Missouri Board for Architects, Professional Engineers, Professional Land Surveyors, and Professional Landscape Architects Chapter 16—Missouri [Minimum] Standards for Property Boundary Surveys 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2030-16.010 Application of Standards. The board is amend- 
ing the header, purpose statement, and the text of the rule. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being amended to reflect modern day prac- tice and terminology. 
PURPOSE: These [minimum] standards provide the professional land surveyor and recipient of boundary surveys with a realistic guideline for adequate survey performance. This rule describes the types of surveys to which these [minimum] standards apply. 
The [minimum] standards in this chapter apply to all property boundary surveys made for determining the location of land bound- aries and land boundary corners, but do not apply to preliminary plats or plans, plot plans, [engineering] design surveys; geodetic surveys; or cartographic surveys[, or Surveyor’s Real Property Report]. Any individual or corporation [registered] licensed with the board to perform land surveying services in this state shall be familiar with and comply with these [minimum] standards. The Missouri [Minimum] Standards for Property Boundary Surveys are not intended to be used in place of professional land surveying [judgement] judgment. There may be special circumstances and conditions that make it impractical to comply with some provisions of the [minimum] standards. If the survey deviates from these [min- imum] standards, this deviation shall be noted, described, and justi- fied on the plat of survey by the professional land surveyor. This pro- vision cannot be used to intentionally circumvent the basic tenets of these [minimum] standards. 
AUTHORITY: sections 327.041 and 327.272, RSMo [Supp. 1993] 2016. This rule originally filed as 4 CSR 30-16.010. Original rule filed May 3, 1994, effective Dec. 30, 1994.

Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2030—Missouri Board for Architects, Professional Engineers, Professional Land Surveyors, and Professional Landscape Architects Chapter 16—Missouri Standards for Property Boundary Surveys 
PROPOSED RULE 20 CSR 2030-16.020 Definitions 
PURPOSE: This rule defines the various technical and legal terms used in this chapter. 
(1) Condominium Survey—A property boundary survey that cre- ates and defines condominium property in accordance with Chapter 448, RSMo. 
(2) Controlling Corners—Those corners that determine the location of the exterior corners of the surveyed boundary. 
(3) Exterior Corners—Corners that define the shape and size of the parcel. 
(4) Material Variations—The differences between surveyed lines and lines of possession or measurements called for in the record source of the property being surveyed that are, in the professional judgment of the professional land surveyor, significant enough to warrant par- ticular notice. 
(5) Original Survey—A survey which creates a new parcel, or parcels, out of a larger parent tract. 
(6) Physical Monument—Natural or artificial objects which are accepted and used to mark boundaries and corners. 
(7) Positional Uncertainty—The positive and negative range of values expected for a computed horizontal position as a result of random errors. 
(8) Property Boundary Survey—Any survey that creates, defines, marks, remarks, retraces, or reestablishes the boundaries of parcels of real property or the subdivision of lands. 
(9) Property Description—A description of the limits of real property by recitation of metes and bounds or by an aliquot part of the United States Public Land Survey System or by lot or parcel designation ref- erenced to a subdivision, survey, or other document recorded in the public records. 
(10) Random Errors—Unavoidable errors in measurement that are caused by the inability of the operator to make exact measurements. (Random errors generally follow statistical principles and can be reduced with care in measurement, but can never be completely eliminated.) 
(11) Record Title Boundaries—The limits of real property ownership as evidenced and provable by one (1) or more written means of real property transfer and having provided constructive notification by being duly entered into the public records. 
(12) Rural Property—Any property that is not urban property. 
(13) Subdivision—A property boundary survey that partitions land into two (2) or more parcels by platting the divisions of land in accor- dance with Chapter 445, RSMo. 
(14) Systematic Errors—Errors in measurement that conform to mathematical and physical laws and remain the same under set con- ditions. Systematic errors are detectible and can be removed by ensuring the proper adjustment of equipment, by applying appropri- ate corrections to observations, and by using appropriate observation techniques to eliminate the effects of imperfection in equipment manufacture. 
(15) United States Public Land Survey Corners—Those points that determine the boundaries of the various subdivisions of the United States Public Land Survey as set forth in section 60.301(1), RSMo. 
(16) Urban Property—Any property that is located wholly or partly within the corporate limits of any municipality or any commercial, industrial, or multi-unit developmental property.

tion of the parcel or parent tract taken from the public records; and (B) Prior to performing the fieldwork, the professional land sur- veyor shall acquire sufficient data to ascertain the record title boundary of the parcel(s) to be surveyed (such as, adjoining deeds, maps, right- of- way plans, subdivision plats, original plats and notes, and subsequent surveys). This requirement does not obligate 
the professional land surveyor to search the entire chain of title. 
(2) Field Investigation. The professional land surveyor or a person under his/her direct personal supervision shall— 
(A) Search thoroughly for monuments and accessories at the nec- essary controlling corners and any other physical evidence that may be required to define the location of the exterior corners of the parcel surveyed (such as location of streets, roads, lines of occupation, and parole information); 
(B) Obtain appropriate and sufficiently redundant measurements to correlate all found evidence; 
(C) Evaluate the reliability of the evidence and monuments found and apply the proper theory of location in accordance with surveying precedent; and 
(D) Reach a conclusion on the location of the boundary and set monuments as defined herein. 
(3) Monumentation. (A) The professional land surveyor shall establish semi-perma- 
nent or confirm existing monuments at every exterior corner of the tract being surveyed, except for lines running along streams or lakes where witness monuments must be set along the connected sidelines. When it is impractical to set a monument at a required corner, a wit- ness monument shall be set along a line of the survey or the prolon- gation thereof; 
(B) Existing monuments shall be evaluated for permanency by the professional land surveyor. Those needing restoration, preservation, or replacement shall receive the due care necessary to ensure that their permanency is secured in accordance with the requirements set forth herein; 
(C) Additional Monumentation for Subdivision Surveys. 1. In addition to meeting the requirements set forth above, the professional land surveyor shall, prior to the recording of the sub- division plat, establish at least two (2) permanent monuments for every four (4) acres of land developed by the subdivision. This requirement is waived if the survey does not create more than four 
(4) lots or parcels. 2. The permanent monuments required in paragraph (3)(C)1. 
shall be set prior to the recording of the plat or, if likely to be destroyed by construction, may be installed upon completion of the construction and must be set no later than twelve (12) months after the recording of the plat. The professional land surveyor shall also monument all lot corners in the subdivision with semi-permanent or witness monuments within the same twelve- (12-) month period.

3. When the subdivision is a cemetery, the requirements of paragraph (3)(C)1. for installation of permanent monuments shall be increased to include four (4) permanent monuments per block, and the monumentation of all lot corners required in paragraph (3)(C)2. shall not be required; and 
(D) Condominium surveys shall meet the requirements for subdi- visions. 
(4) Publication of Results. A plat shall be made showing the results of the survey or subdivision and shall conform to all of the follow- ing provisions: 
(A) The plat shall include a drawing that shall be made to a con- venient scale on a reasonably permanent and dimensionally stable material; 
(B) The plat shall include the name of the person or entity for whom the survey was made and the date of the survey; 
(C) Lettering shall be no less than eight-hundredths of an inch (0.08") in height. All characters shall be open, well-rounded, and of uniform width; 
(D) The direction of boundary lines shall be shown by angles, azimuths, or bearings with the directional reference system clearly described on the plat; 
(E) A north arrow, a written scale, and a graphic scale shall be shown on every sheet containing graphic survey data; 
(F) Complete dimensions (distances, directions, and curve data) of all parcels surveyed or created. All linear measurements shall be shown as horizontal distances at the ground surface in feet or meters. Curved lines shall show at least two (2) elements. For non-tangential curves, a directional component shall be included to help define the direction of the curve (preferably the chord bearing); 
(G) All vertical measurements shall be shown as elevations above an established or assumed datum in feet or meters. When elevations are shown, a clearly defined elevation datum shall be shown, includ- ing the location and elevation of the benchmark used to establish the project datum; 
(H) Measurements and calculated areas will be shown on the plat to a number of significant figures representative of the actual preci- sion of the measurements; 
(I) The plat shall display either a property description for the par- cel(s) and/or parent tract surveyed or a reference to the source doc- ument from which the property description was taken. Any new par- cel created by survey shall have its property description shown on the plat and must be complete enough so that the parcel can be located and clearly identified. Subdivision plats shall identify all lots for sale by numbers, as set forth in section 445.010, RSMo; 
(J) The plat shall show sufficient data (distances and directions) to positively locate the parcel surveyed within the United States Public Land Survey System (USPLSS) or within the recorded subdivision. If the survey cannot be located by either of the previously mentioned provisions, it must be referenced to other lines and points sufficiently established by record; 
(K) All controlling corner monuments that were found and exteri- or corners that were found or set shall be identified on the plat; 
(L) Any material variation between record and measured dimen- sions, and any material variation and the extent of such variation between surveyed lines and lines of possession at all exterior corners, shall be shown on the plat. Material variation will include, but is not limited to, survey monuments, fences, obvious occupation (i.e., mowed) lines, walls, or other structures whether on the property sur- veyed or on adjacent property; 
(M) The plat shall reference the source document(s) for any perti- nent data obtained during the records research provision set forth above. The plat shall also reference the property type (urban or rural); 
(N) The identity of the record title documents for adjoining prop- erties, consistent with the records research provision set forth above, shall be shown on the plat, including the record source; 
(O) In addition to the above, all condominium surveys shall show 
the pertinent information required in section 448.2-109, RSMo, and the legally sufficient descriptions of easements serving or burdening the condominium; and 
(P) The plat shall include a statement that the survey and or sub- division were executed in accordance with the Missouri Standards for Property Boundary Surveys as set forth herein. The statement on a condominium plat shall also include a declaration that the plat con- tains all information required by section 448.2-109, RSMo. 
(5) Deliverables. The professional land surveyor shall furnish to the client a plat containing the drawing and other pertinent infor- mation identified above. Each sheet of the plat shall bear the signa- ture and seal of the professional land surveyor in responsible charge. This signed and sealed plat shall be the official plat and shall take precedence over any other formatted data that may be delivered to the client or his/her representatives, successors, or assigns.

Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2030—Missouri Board for Architects, Professional Engineers, Professional Land Surveyors, and Professional Landscape Architects Chapter 18—First and Second Order Horizontal and Vertical Control 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2030-18.010 Definitions. The board is amending sections 
(1) and (2). 
PURPOSE: This rule is being amended to provide more clarity to the definitions of positional accuracy and relative accuracy. 
(1) Positional accuracy of a station is the [accuracy] uncertainty in the position of the station [related] relative to the [reference] sta- tions that are held fixed (i.e., National Geodetic Survey (NGS) or other higher order stations) in the process of the adjustment. Positional accuracy of a station is computed from the constrained, correctly weighted, least squares adjustment at the ninety-five per- cent (95%) confidence level. 
(2) Relative accuracy is the [relative] uncertainty in the position of one station [with respect] relative to another station. It is comput- ed for all directly connected stations from the minimally constrained, and the constrained correctly weighted, least squares adjustment at the ninety-five percent (95%) confidence level.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2030-18.030 Accuracy of Horizontal Control. The board 
is amending sections (1)–(4). 
PURPOSE: This rule is being amended for clarity and to change ref- erence from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey to the Missouri Department of Agriculture and the National Geodetic Survey or its successor organization. 
(1) The accuracy of a horizontal control station is classified accord- ing to constrained and unconstrained, relative accuracy of the dis- tance between [the] stations, and the positional accuracy of the sta- tion relative to the [known] stations held fixed in the adjustment. [The failure to meet any of the three criteria shall cause the station to not meet the classification.] If the requirements for all three (3) criteria are not satisfied, the station shall fail to qual- ify for the classification. 
(2) First Order Horizontal Control. (A) The relative accuracy of the distance between directly connect- 
ed adjacent [points] stations shall be equal to or less than twelve millimeters (12 mm) for distances equal or less than one kilometer (1 km) and ten parts per million (10 ppm) for distances greater than one kilometer (1 km). 
(3) Second Order Horizontal Control. (A) The relative accuracy of the distance between directly connect- 
ed adjacent [points] stations shall be equal to or less than twenty- five millimeters (25 mm) for distances equal to or less than one kilo- meter (1 km) and twenty parts per million (20 ppm) for distances greater than one kilometer (1 km). 
(4) To fully qualify as a first or second order control station, the sta- tion must be accepted and published by the Missouri Department of [Natural Resources] Agriculture or the [United States Coast and] National Geodetic Survey or its successor organization.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
20 CSR 2030-18.040 Acceptance and Publication by [DNR] Missouri Department of Agriculture. The board is amending the rule title, and sections (1), (2), (3), (5), (6), and (7). 
PURPOSE: This rule is being amended to reflect publication by the Missouri Department of Agriculture instead of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. 
(1) The following information will be submitted for each control sur- vey that is to be evaluated for inclusion into the Missouri Geographic Reference System (MO GRS) as a first or second order station. 
(C) A north arrow and graphic scale should appear on the sketch. All station symbols should be labeled with the station name [with an inset used]. [w]When stations are spaced too closely together to be clearly depicted on the network sketch, an inset shall be used. 
(2) A report shall be submitted for each project and shall be signed and sealed by the professional land surveyor or professional engi- neer in responsible charge. The report shall be the main source of information for judging whether or not the stations should be accept- ed as MO GRS stations. It shall be the responsibility of the profes- sional land surveyor or professional engineer to supply sufficient information in the report to facilitate inclusion of the stations in the MO GRS. 
(3) The report shall contain a clear description of the survey proce- dures and equipment used in the field. This includes, but is not lim- ited to, the information entered into the field log and auxiliary infor- mation such as logistics, preanalysis [and] satellite selection results (if Global Positioning System (GPS) survey), personnel involved, and difficulties encountered. 
(5) The following shall be included for GPS surveys. The version number and date of the GPS software used must be reported. For GPS surveys, the professional land surveyor or professional engi- neer must also specifically report the baselines rejected for the pro- ject. All parameters used for any coordinate transformations shall be presented and any scaling of the covariance matrix by the profession- al land surveyor or professional engineer must be described in detail. If the covariance matrix has been scaled, the scale factor used

must also be presented. These results must be reported for all single base line and network solutions. Statistical testing of the survey results from the network solution, including analysis of variance fac- tors, semi-major axis of [2-d] two- (2-) dimensional (horizontal) or [3-d] three- (3-) dimensional (horizontal and vertical) ninety-five percent (95%) relative confidence regions between all directly con- nected pairs of [points] stations, residuals and residual outliers shall be provided. In addition, the results of any self-validation checks must be reported, including, but not limited to, comparisons of any repeated single base line solutions. 
(6) For traverse surveys, all field data used to determine directions, distances, azimuths, and elevations, as well as the adjustment calcu- lations, shall be submitted along with the name of the software used in the adjustment. The data submitted shall show the final results of the adjustment and the error analysis. 
(7) Only those stations meeting the requirements of [10 CSR 30- 4.030, 10 CSR 30-4.040, 10 CSR 30-4.050 and 10 CSR 30-4.060] 2 CSR 90-62.030, 2 CSR 90-62.040, 2 CSR 90- 62.050, and 2 CSR 90-62.060 will be accepted for publication in the MO GRS.

Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2030—Missouri Board for Architects, Professional Engineers, Professional Land Surveyors, and Professional Landscape Architects Chapter 18—First and Second Order Horizontal and Vertical Control 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2030-18.050 GPS Survey Guidelines. The board is amend- 
ing sections (1), (2), (3), (4), (8), (9), (10), and (11). 
PURPOSE: This rule is being amended to reflect modern-day termi- nology and to be in compliance with HB 650, which was passed in 2013 and moves the State Land Surveyor’s Office from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources to the Missouri Department of Agriculture. 
(1) Direct connections must be made to any adjacent observable National [Geographic] Spatial Reference System ([NGRS] NSRS) 
and/or Missouri Geographic Reference System (MO GRS) station located five kilometers (5 km) or less from any new station. 
(2) At least three (3) existing higher or equal order control points must be included in any proposed Global Positioning System (GPS) survey. Whenever possible, these should be three (3) [3-d] three- (3-) dimen- sional control [points] stations. Otherwise, two (2) sets of three (3) [points] stations (three (3) [2-d] two- (2-) dimensional horizontal [points] stations and three (3) vertical control [points] stations) must be used. These control [points] stations should be chosen to be roughly equidistant on the periphery of the [network] proposed project so that they enclose as much of the [proposed network] project as possible. 
(3) Each new [point] station to be established by the proposed GPS survey must be occupied at least two (2) separate times to enable proper checking of blunders (for example, incorrect point, setup errors, incorrect antenna heights). A separate occupation is one [where] in which the antenna [has] and its supporting device (tri- pod) have been taken down and set up again and the receiver restart- ed. 
(4) Each [point] station must be connected by simultaneous occupa- tions ([that is, base line] baselines) to at least three (3) other [points] stations in the network after outlier [base lines] baselines have been rejected from the adjustment. Because it is generally easier to resolve the integer phase ambiguities over shorter base line, adja- cent [points] stations should be connected wherever possible. 
(8) A detailed field log must be kept during observation taken at each station. At the very least the following information must be recorded: (A) Universal Time [Correction] Coordinated (UTC) date of 
observations; (F) Antenna height and offset from monument, if any, to one mil- 
limeter (1 mm). Note should be made [of any deviation from standard method of measuring HI] as to whether the height is measured as a slant height or vertical height; 
(K) Completed field log data forms for each station occupation will be submitted either using those provided by the Missouri Department of [Natural Resources (DNR)] Agriculture (MDA) or some other type containing all necessary information [found] included on the [DNR] MDA forms. 
(9) The raw data files for all station occupations must be submitted. Each file[, called an R-file,] will consist of one (1) set of raw obser- vations for each station occupation session. For example, four (4) receivers operating during each of five (5) sessions will produce twenty (20) [R-files] raw data files. [An example of a raw data file would be the DAT, ION, MES, and EPH files produced by a Trimble receiver during a station occupation.] 
(10) The unadjusted base line vector solution files for all observed [base lines] baselines, non-trivial and trivial, will be submitted. [These files are produced by post-processing software such as the OPT or FIX, FLT, and TRP files produced by Trimvec post-processing software.] 
(11) If station description information is not provided by [DNR] MDA, it must be submitted for each station occupied. Station descriptions must include station name, county, township, range, sec- tion, United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 [‘quad.] minute quadrangle name, date monumented, date of observations, complete descriptions of the station, azimuth and all reference monuments, a current “to reach” description, and any special information such as property owner name, address, and phone number. A sketch depict- ing the station and reference marks with dimensions and directions shown should accompany all narrative data. Examples of complete station description information may be obtained from [DNR] MDA.

WORK ORDER 
Please read carefully and indicate the type of service you wish to order. 
. . . Surveyor’s Real Property Report: It is a location of improvements and cursory check for encroachments onto or from the subject property based on existing but not confirmed evidence. This does not constitute a boundary survey and is subject to any inaccuracies that a subsequent boundary survey may disclose. No property corners will be set and it should not be used or relied upon for the establishment of any fence, structure or other improvement. No warranty of any kind is extended therein to the present or future owner or occupant. 
. . . Property Boundary Survey with Location of Improvement: A boundary survey of the subject property will be made and the property corners will be located and verified or reset. The improvements on the prop- erty will be located and encroachments onto or from the subject property will be determined. This survey can be used by the property owner for the construction of a fence or other improvements. The survey will meet “[Minimum] Missouri Standards for Property Boundary Surveys.” 
. . . ALTA/ACSM (American Land Title Association/American Congress on Surveying and Mapping) Land Title Survey: This is the most comprehensive type of survey and improvement location. It covers all the aspects of the boundary survey and improvement location and identification for any additional evidence of possession or use which could be adverse to the interests of the purchaser. This type of survey is normally only performed on commercial property because of the expense involved. 
I (We), the undersigned, have read, understand and have indicated the type of service desired and have authorized the work to be performed and agree to be responsible for the bill for this survey.

Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 90—Weights and Measures Chapter 10—Liquefied Petroleum Gases 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Propane Safety Commission under section 323.010, RSMo 2016, the commission amends a rule as follows: 
2 CSR 90-10.001 Definitions and General Provisions is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on August 1, 2016 (41 MoReg 939). No changes have been made in the text of the proposed amendment, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Missouri Propane Safety Commission received one (1) comment on the proposed amendment. 
COMMENT: The Missouri Propane Gas Association supports the addition of this definition which reflects minor changes to the train- ing rule contained in 2 CSR 90-10.012. RESPONSE: No changes have been made to the amendment as a result of this comment. 
Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 90—Weights and Measures Chapter 10—Liquefied Petroleum Gases 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Propane Safety Commission under section 323.020, RSMo 2016, the commission amends a rule as follows: 
2 CSR 90-10.011 is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on August 1, 2016 (41 MoReg 939–940). No changes have been made in the text of the proposed amendment. However, a new revised public cost has been submitted and is herein printed. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Missouri Propane Safety Commission received two (2) comments on the proposed amendment. 
COMMENT #1: Robbie Roberts, Bolivar, commented that adopting the 2017 edition of NFPA 58 should include the costs of compliance with the new standard and challenges the private cost of compliance of less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: State statute (section 323.020.2, RSMo) requires the commission to adopt regula- tions “in substantial conformity” with the published standards of the National Fire Protection Association. Therefore, it is the commis- sion’s opinion that any compliance costs incurred with new editions of these standards are already required by state law. The changes in NFPA 58 are available to the public at www.nfpa.org and have two (2) open public comment periods prior to publication. Upon further review, the commission has thoroughly reviewed the changes made in the 2017 edition of NFPA 58 and has determined that additional com- pliance costs may exist for cathodic protection of buried steel pipe. As a result, the commission is filing a revised fiscal cost as part of its order of rulemaking. 
COMMENT #2: The Missouri Propane Gas Association supports the adoption of the latest edition of NFPA 58. In the past, the former Missouri Propane Inspection Authority had been slow to adopt new editions, or skip them completely, which causes confusion with the applicability of the national codes and hinders education on any new developments. 
The NFPA code is the product of consensus between experts in all related fields. The National Propane Gas Association is involved in the development of new standards and MPGA staff also sit in on the decision-making which affords the industry both input on content and a timeline for any new changes of merit. We encourage the commis- sion to continue its timely adoption of new editions of national stan- dards which are already mandated by existing state law. RESPONSE: The commission agrees that under previous oversight, the implementation of national codes was too often delayed which created situations with overlapping requirements. It is the intention of this commission to be proactive in adopting current national stan- dards, as directed by state statute, in order to provide ample time for education and compliance. No changes have been made to the amendment as a result of this comment. 
2 CSR 90-10.011 Inspection Authority—Duties 
REVISED PUBLIC COST: The cost to the public may range from zero to three thousand dollars ($0–$3000) versus the less than five hundred dollars ($500), which was submitted with the original pro- posal.

Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 90—Weights and Measures Chapter 10—Liquefied Petroleum Gases 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Propane Safety Commission under section 323.020, RSMo 2016, the commission amends a rule as follows: 
2 CSR 90-10.012 Registration—Training is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on August 1, 2016 (41 MoReg 940). No changes have been made in the text of the proposed amendment, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The commission received two (2) comments on the proposed amendment. 
COMMENT # 1: Robbie Roberts, Bolivar, commented that the word- ing appears to create a new approval process for trainers which would increase costs. RESPONSE: The previous rule required instruction by a “competent” trainer which was not defined. The proposed rule recognizes the exist- ing approval procedure while making other small changes to wording that do not substantially change the training requirement. No changes have been made to the amendment as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #2: Missouri Propane Gas Association supports the inclusion of the term “converting” to the other types of activities which require basic propane training. While this activity may have been inferred from the current language covering “installing” and “repairing,” this is a necessary clarification that covers an important aspect of propane safety. 
MPGA also supports the clarification of the instructor and curricu- lum approval process. We ask the commission to remain diligent in ensuring that any curriculum approved under the auspices of this rule is provided in an appropriate manner. The commission has long held that approved instruction must be led by a knowledgeable trainer. Our understanding of the intent of this proposed rule is to continue that process. Electronic digital, online, e-learning, other undirected self- study or similar means, may only supplement, but not replace the core learning required by the program. RESPONSE: No changes have been made to the amendment as a result of this comment. 
Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 90—Weights and Measures Chapter 10—Liquefied Petroleum Gases 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Propane Safety Commission under section 323.020, RSMo 2016, the commission amends a rule as follows: 
2 CSR 90-10.013 Installation Requirements is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on August 1, 2016 (41 MoReg 940). No changes have been made in the text of the proposed amendment, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The commission received one (1) comment. 
COMMENT: The Missouri Propane Gas Association supports the elimination of the required leak-check documentation. RESPONSE: No changes have been made to the amendment as a result of this comment. 
Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 90—Weights and Measures Chapter 10—Liquefied Petroleum Gases 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Propane Safety Commission under section 323.020, RSMo 2016, the commission amends a rule as follows: 
2 CSR 90-10.020 NFPA Manual No. 54, National Fuel Gas Code is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on August 1, 2016 (41 MoReg 940–941). No changes have been made in the text of the proposed amendment, so it is not reprinted here. This pro- posed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The commission received two (2) comments on the proposed amendment. 
COMMENT #1: Robbie Roberts, Bolivar, opposes the proposed pro- hibition on converting appliances from one (1) fuel source to another if such conversion is prohibited by the manufacturer. RESPONSE: Hundreds of gas appliances are manufactured in such a way as to allow conversion from one (1) fuel source to another. In some cases, however, manufacturers specifically prohibit the prac- tice. The 2015 edition of NFPA 54, which is the current state stan- dard, addresses this issue: 
9.1.3 Type of Gas(es) “The appliance shall be connected to the fuel gas for which it was designed. No attempt shall be made to con- vert the appliance from the gas specified on the rating plate for use with a different gas without consulting the installation instructions, the serving gas supplier, or the appliance manufacturer for complete instructions.” 
The commission has learned that the “serving gas supplier” lan- guage has sometimes been used by a fuel provider to ignore the man- ufacturer’s instructions and improperly convert a gas appliance from one (1) fuel source to another. This proposed rule clarifies the exist- ing state standard that prohibits such conversion. No changes have been made to this amendment as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #2: The Missouri Propane Gas Association supports this additional clarification of 2015 NFPA 54 Section 9.1.3. Eliminating the misinterpretation of this part of the national code is a necessary safeguard for public safety. 
Clearly, fuel suppliers who modify gas appliances despite manu- facturer warnings are transferring liability from the appliance manu- facturer directly to the customer, often without the customer’s knowl- edge or consent. The action may invalidate warranties, can compro- mise performance and safety, and can cause confusion and the poten- tial for tragedy if those appliances re-enter the market still bearing the ratings plate of the initial fuel. There is no good reason to allow the improper conversion of gas appliances which have been prohibit- ed by the manufacturer merely as a convenience to a fuel supplier. RESPONSE: No changes have been made to this amendment as a result of this comment.

Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 90—Weights and Measures Chapter 10—Liquefied Petroleum Gases 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Propane Safety Commission under section 323.020, RSMo 2016, the commission amends a rule as follows: 
2 CSR 90-10.040 NFPA Manual No. 58, Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on August 1, 2016 (41 MoReg 941). No changes have been made in the text of the proposed amendment, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The commission received one (1) comment on the proposed amendment change. 
COMMENT: Missouri Propane Gas Association’s understanding is that this proposed amendment more appropriately assigns the train- ing responsibility regarding the operating of dispensing equipment. The operator of the equipment, which employs the personnel to oper- ate it, should have primary responsibility for their training. We do believe that the entity installing the equipment also retains some responsibility to initially train the operator before the equipment is placed into service. We suggest that the commission monitor such training to determine if the need exists to promulgate a rule to require such. 
RESPONSE: No changes have been made to this amendment as a result of this comment, and the commission will continue to ensure anyone operating a propane dispenser has training that meets current rules. 
Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 90—Weights and Measures Chapter 10—Liquefied Petroleum Gases

A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the proposed rescission was published in the Missouri Register on August 1, 2016 (41 MoReg 941). No changes have been made in the proposed rescission, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed rescission becomes effec- tive thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The commission received one (1) comment on the proposed rescission change. 
COMMENT: The Missouri Propane Gas Association supports the rescission of this rule. RESPONSE: No changes have been made to this rescission as a result of this comment.

Title 11—DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY Division 45—Missouri Gaming Commission Chapter 9—Internal Control System 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Gaming Commission under section 313.805, RSMo 2016, the commission amends a rule as fol- lows: 
11 CSR 45-9.108 is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on September 1, 2016 (41 MoReg 1078). Changes have been made to the text of the proposed revision of the Minimum Internal Control Standards (MICS) as incorporated by reference in Chapter H, and those changes are explained below. Changes have been made to the text of the proposed amendment, so it is reprinted here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: A public hearing was held on this proposed amendment on October 4, 2016. No one attended the pub- lic hearing. Three (3) written comments were received. 
COMMENT #1: H § 3.14—Mike Winter with the Missouri Gaming Association stated, “This change would significantly impact guest service. By limiting a property’s ability to allow front line cashiers the ability to create a paid-in / paid-out a property will not be able to pay out guest disputes from the front line window. This will add sig- nificant time into the process and increase guest frustration.” RESPONSE: No change was made to the standard. The standard already allows for the creation of a paid-out by the cashier for redemption kiosk disputes. Allowing a cashier to create documenta- tion that enables the window to balance introduces risk into this process. Therefore, the reasons for creating this documentation needs to be limited. Each casino has the option of having a floating employ- ee window accessible to the floor, if the main bank is not accessible to handle these types of transactions that do not result in an even exchange or the exchange of documentation created by an indepen- dent source. 
COMMENT #2: H § 7.02—Jamie Doss with Isle of Capri Boonville stated, “We recommend that if a BV can is removed/added from a redemption kiosk that it not trigger the requirement to be counted down and reconciled within twenty-four (24) hours. The BV cans fill up quickly on the weekends with currency and e-tickets. There is minimal risk by removing the BV can when the currency cassettes remain untouched. Anytime a currency cassette is removed or added, the kiosk will be counted down and reconciled within twenty-four (24) hours as required.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff agreed with this recommendation. MICS Chapter H § 7.02 was revised to read— “If at any time, additional currency is added to or any curren- cy is removed from the redemption kiosk’s cassettes or a cassette is replaced, the kiosk shall be counted down and reconciled within twenty-four (24) hours.” 
COMMENT #3: H § 8.04—Mike Winter with the Missouri Gaming Association stated “This will impact a property’s ability to service guests in a timely manner. As an example, in the event of a cashier running out of a specific currency due to a large payout, cashiers can complete a funds transfer to replenish the bank until a transfer from main bank is completed. The risk associated with this process is mit- igated since a transfer sheet is utilized and a paper trail is created.” RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: MICS Chapter H § 8.04 was revised to read—“Exchanges shall not be conducted between cage frontline windows, except for even exchanges of curren- cy.”

Title 11—DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY Division 45—Missouri Gaming Commission Chapter 30—Bingo 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Gaming Commission under section 313.065, RSMo 2016, the commission adopts a rule as fol- lows: 
11 CSR 45-30.056 Key Person Defined is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on August 1, 2016 (41 MoReg 946–947). No changes have been made to the text of the pro- posed rule, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: A public hearing was held on this proposed rule on September 13, 2016. No comments were made at the public hearing and one (1) written comment was received. 
COMMENT #1: Mary Magnuson, from the National Association of Fundraising Ticket Manufacturers, submitted concerns regarding the use of the phrase “involvement in the entity would tend to discredit charitable bingo” as a criteria for denying a license. She wrote, “the proposed rule contains a vague and subjective standard that is sus- ceptible to arbitrary and discriminatory application.” In addition she was concerned that the proposed rule provides no guidance so that manufacturers and suppliers of bingo equipment may “determine the type of conduct that will affect their licensure.” 
RESPONSE: This language is consistent with the statutory require- ments that a license be issued to a person the commission determines is “suitable.” The phrase “tend to discredit charitable bingo opera- tions” is also used in section 313.052, RSMo, regarding grounds for disciplinary action against licensees, including revocation. The pro- posal of this rule is intended to define key person as it relates to the licensing and conduct of bingo and not to alter any licensing stan- dards that the commission has historically employed. No changes have been made as a result of this comment.
