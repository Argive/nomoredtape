ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Dental Board under section 332.031, RSMo 2016, the board rescinds a rule as follows: 
20 CSR 2110-2.110 Addressing the Public—Dentists is rescinded. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the proposed rescission was published in the Missouri Register on January 2, 2018 (43 MoReg 10). No changes have been made in the proposed rescission, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed rescission becomes effec- tive thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended on February 2, 2018. The board received twenty-one (21) timely written comments in response to the proposed rescission. 
COMMENT #1: Dr. Michael G. Durbin, on behalf of the Missouri Society of Orthodontists (MSO) as well as the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO), voiced opposition to the proposed rescis- sion. Dr. Durbin’s concerns are that rescinding the rule would not provide a definition of what constitutes advertising so some dentists may view certain communication mediums as non-advertising and unknowingly advertise inappropriately to the public which could mis- lead the public. Dr. Durbin also expressed concern that rescinding the rule would eliminate the requirement that a dentist’s name be included in the advertisement enabling an office to advertise without the public knowing who the dentist was advertising the service. Dr. Durbin also expressed concern that rescinding the rule would remove provision allowing dentists to list degree credentials such as D.D.S. and D.M.D. or other credentials potentially creating scenarios where dentists could unknowingly advertise inappropriately and the public would be misled. Another concern Dr. Durbin expressed was that rescinding the rule would eliminate the requirement that general den- tists identify that they are general dentists using print equal to or larg- er than the announcement of services, and clearly audible, with speech volume and pace equal to the announcement of services. Dr. Durbin also expressed concern that rescinding the rule would elimi- nate the requirement that general dentists use a disclaimer when advertising specialty services. Dr. Durbin identified this requirement as 20 CSR 2110-2.110(7). Dr. Durbin also expressed concern that rescinding the rule would eliminate the provisions requiring dentist who are advertising the availability and price of goods, appliances, or services to do so in a clear and non-deceptive manner and prohibiting deceptive advertisements of free services or offers of discounts or credit towards services. Finally Dr. Durbin expressed concern that rescinding the rule could create a situation where dentists could pub- lish dental health articles, messages, or newsletters in a manner that is false, misleading, or deceptive to the public by not truthfully dis- closing the source and authorship, or designing the article to give rise to questionable expectations for the purpose of inducing the public to utilize the services of the sponsoring dentist. 
RESPONSE: The Missouri Dental Board appreciates Dr. Durbin’s input regarding the proposed rescission; however the board does not agree with his concerns. Section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, prohibits dentists from advertising in a way that is false, misleading, or decep- tive to the public and provides examples of actions that are consid- ered false, misleading, or deceptive. While the statute does not con- tain a specific list defining that advertising means a communication between a dentist or dental office and the public and does not provide limited examples such as business cards, signs, web pages, Internet communications, radio, television, newspaper, and magazine ads, the board feels like this is a common sense issue and that dentists are able to recognize without such a definition that if they are communi- cating the availability of services to the public they are advertising. The board also does not agree that the requirement for advertise- ments to contain the name of a dentist is essential for public protec- tion. Not having a dentist’s name listed does not automatically make the advertisement false, misleading, or deceptive. Likewise, the board does not agree that the provision allowing dentists to use cre- dentials such as D.D.S., D.M.D., doctor, or other titles is necessary to protect the public. The same authorization is found in section 332.071(9), RSMo, which authorizes a dentist to use the titles or words “”Doctor”, “Dentist”, “Dr.”, “D.D.S.”, or “D.M.D.”, or

Orders of Rulemaking 

any other letters, titles, degrees, or descriptive matter which directly or indirectly indicate or imply that the person is willing or able to perform any type of dental service for any person or persons, or uses or permits the use of for the person’s benefit or for the benefit of any other person or other entity any card, directory, poster, sign, or any other means by which the person indicates, implies, or represents that the person is willing or able to perform any type of dental ser- vices or operation for any person.” The board believes Dr. Durbin is incorrect about 20 CSR 2110-2.110(7) requiring general dentists to use a disclaimer when advertising specialty services. 20 CSR 2110- 2.110(7) requires any dentist to use a disclaimer if advertising a non- ADA recognized specialty area. The protection Dr. Durbin is con- cerned about is actually found in statute. Section 332.321.2(14)(f), RSMo, requires that a general dentist who advertises any of the terms denoting recognized specialties, or other descriptive terms carrying the same meaning must use a disclaimer specifically prescribed by the statute denoting that the dentist advertising the specialty service is not a specialist. The statute, which is not being changed, appears to provide the protection Dr. Durbin is seeking. Additionally, Section 332.321.2(14)(g), RSMo, explicitly prohibits dentists from advertising non-ADA recognized specialty areas further nullifying the need for 20 CSR 2110-2.110(7), RSMo. Dr. Durbin’s concern about requiring general dentists to dentists identify that they are gen- eral dentists using print equal to or larger than the announcement of services, and clearly audible, with speech volume and pace equal to the announcement of services would also appear to be related to his concern about general dentists advertising specialty services. Again, the protection Dr. Durbin is seeking is found in section 332.321.2(14), RSMo. Additionally, requiring the identification of a dentist as a general dentist in print equal to or larger than the announcement of services, and with speech volume and pace equal to the announcement of services would seem to be unduly burden- some and cost prohibitive for dentist wishing to advertise services that they can lawfully provide. The board also believes that the con- cerns Dr. Durbin expressed regarding requiring non-deceptive adver- tising of the price and availability of goods, appliances, or services as well as prohibiting deceptive advertisements of free services or offers of discounts or credit towards services is well covered by exist- ing statute. Section 332.321.2(14)(b),(c) and (d), RSMo, expressly prohibit false, misleading, or deceptive advertising of free services, reduced costs or greater savings, or the advertisement of fees. If a dentist is advertising fees, free services or the price and availability of goods, appliances or services in a way that is false, misleading, or deceptive, section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, states that is illegal and the dentist engaging in such activity may be subject to discipline. Finally, the board does not agree that it is necessary to have a regu- lation defining a dental health article, message, or newsletter under a dentist’s byline that does not make truthful disclosure of the author/source or is designed to give rise to questionable expectations for the purpose of inducing the public to utilize a dentist’s/dental hygienist’s services as false, misleading, or deceptive. Basic logic would seem to indicate that an advertisement employing such tactics would be false, misleading, or deceptive and therefore illegal in accordance with section 332.321.2(14), RSMo. The board does not believe that the public is truly further protected by this rule beyond the protections provided in section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, against false, misleading, or deceptive advertisements. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in upholding a 2016 ruling against the Texas Dental Board affirmed a lower court’s ruling that restrictions against adver- tising a lawful activity in a way that was not misleading is a violation of First Amendment protected commercial free speech. There are restrictions in this rule that would seem to be problematic with that ruling and are not essential to the health, safety, or welfare of Missouri residents. The board believes that this rule does not meet the criteria set forth in section 3(c) of Executive Order 17-03 in that it is not essential to the health, safety, or welfare of Missouri resi- dents and that it unduly and adversely affects the competitive envi- ronment in Missouri. Therefore in accordance with the explicit 
instructions of section 3(d) of Executive Order 17-03, the board is seeking to rescind this rule. No change has been made in response to the comment. 
COMMENT #2: Vincent Rapini, D.D.S., on behalf of the Missouri Dental Association (MDA), voiced opposition to the proposed rescis- sion. Dr. Rapini indicated concern that rescinding the rule would eliminate the definition of advertising. He also expressed concern that rescinding the rule would eliminate the requirement that a den- tist’s name be included in the advertisement as well as the require- ment that general dentists identify their practice as one of general dentistry. Dr. Rapini also expressed concern that rescinding the rule would remove the restrictions regarding advertisements of non-ADA recognized specialty areas. He also expressed concern that rescinding the rule would eliminate the restrictions prohibiting dentists from advertising sedation services if the dentist has not obtained a permit authorizing him or her to perform sedation services. Dr. Rapini expressed concern that rescinding the rule could enable dentists to use an offer of free services as part of a “bait and switch” scheme to sell other services to patients which they may not have been seeking. Finally, Dr. Rapini also expressed concern that rescinding the rule would eliminate the provision that prevents a dentist from advertising without truthfully disclosing the source of authority of the informa- tion contained in dental health articles, messages, or newsletters and potentially enticing patients to select that dentist’s services, without providing information that allows the patient to determine whether the dentist actually is licensed in the specialty which may be implied by the article, advertisement, or message. 
RESPONSE: The Missouri Dental Board appreciates Dr. Rapini’s input regarding the proposed rescission; however the board does not agree with his concerns. Section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, prohibits dentists from advertising in a way that is false, misleading, or decep- tive to the public and provides examples of actions that are consid- ered false, misleading, or deceptive. While the statute does not con- tain a specific list defining that advertising means a communication between a dentist or dental office and the public and does not provide limited examples such as business cards, signs, web pages, Internet communications, radio, television, newspaper, and magazine ads, the board feels like this is a common sense issue and that dentists are able to recognize without such a definition that if they are communi- cating the availability of services to the public they are advertising. The board also does not agree that the requirement for advertise- ments to contain the name of a dentist is essential for public protec- tion. Not having a dentist’s name listed does not automatically make the advertisement false, misleading, or deceptive. Likewise, the board does not agree that the provision allowing dentists to use cre- dentials such as D.D.S., D.M.D., doctor or other titles is necessary to protect the public. The same authorization is found in section 332.071(9), RSMo, which authorizes a dentist to use the titles or words “Doctor”, “Dentist”, “Dr.”, “D.D.S.”, or “D.M.D.”, or any other letters, titles, degrees, or descriptive matter which directly or indirectly indicate or imply that the person is willing or able to per- form any type of dental service for any person or persons, or uses or permits the use of for the person’s benefit or for the benefit of any other person or other entity any card, directory, poster, sign, or any other means by which the person indicates or implies or represents that the person is willing or able to perform any type of dental ser- vices or operation for any person.” Dr. Rapini’s concern about requiring general dentists to dentists identify that they are general dentists using print equal to or larger than the announcement of ser- vices, and clearly audible, with speech volume and pace equal to the announcement of services would also appear to be related to a con- cern about general dentists advertising specialty services.

The statute, which is

not being changed, appears to provide the protection Dr. Rapini is seeking. The board does not agree that a regulation regarding dentists advertising non-ADA recognized specialty areas in necessary since section 332.321.2(14)(g), RSMo, explicitly prohibits dentists from advertising non-ADA recognized specialty areas. Likewise, Dr. Rapini’s concerns regarding dentists creating “bait and switch” schemes through the advertising of free services would seem to be addressed by section 332.321.2(14)(b), RSMo, which prohibits mis- leading or deceptive statement offering or promising free services. Finally, the board does not agree with Dr. Rapini’s concerns that it is necessary to have a regulation defining a dental health article, mes- sage, or newsletter under a dentist’s byline that does not make truth- ful disclosure of the author/source or is designed to give rise to ques- tionable expectations for the purpose inducing the public to utilize a dentist’s services as false, misleading, or deceptive is necessary. Basic logic would seem to indicate that an advertisement employing such tactics would be false, misleading, or deceptive and therefore illegal in accordance with section 332.321.2(14), RSMo. The board does not believe that the public is truly further protected by this rule beyond the protections provided in section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, against false, misleading or deceptive advertisements.

Therefore in accordance with the explicit instructions of section 3(d) of Executive Order 17-03, the board is seeking to rescind this rule. No change has been made in response to the comment. 
COMMENT #3: Orthodontist David Blackburn, D.M.D., voiced general opposition to the proposed rescission citing a need for truth- ful and honest advertising in dentistry. RESPONSE: The Missouri Dental Board appreciates Dr. Blackburn’s input regarding the proposed rescission; however the board does not agree that this rule is necessary in fulfilling the board’s mission of protecting the public. Section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, prohibits dentists from advertising in a way that is false, mis- leading, or deceptive to the public and provides examples of actions that are considered false, misleading, or deceptive. The board does not believe that the public is truly further protected by this rule beyond the protections provided in section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, against false, misleading, or deceptive advertisements. The board believes that this rule does not meet the criteria set forth in Section 3(c) of Executive Order 17-03. Therefore in accordance with the explicit instructions of section 3(d) of the Executive Order, the board is seeking to rescind this rule. No change has been made in response to the comment. 
COMMENT #4: Melanie Bogart, employee of Blackburn & Elrod Orthodontists, voiced opposition to the proposed rescission citing a concern that rescinding the rule would allow dentist who are not licensed as specialists to advertise specialty services. 
RESPONSE: The board disagrees that rescinding the rule will enable dentists who are not licensed as specialists to advertise specialty ser- vices. Section 332.321.2(14)(e), RSMo, explicitly prohibits dentists from using the term “specialist” or the phrase “limited to the special- ty of” unless the dentist named in conjunction with the term or phrase, or responsible for the announcement, holds a valid Missouri certificate and license as a specialist in that area. Additionally, sec- tion 332.321.2(14)(f), RSMo, requires that a general dentist who advertises any of the terms denoting recognized specialties, or other descriptive terms carrying the same meaning must use a disclaimer 
specifically prescribed by the statute denoting that the dentist adver- tising the specialty service is not a specialist. The statute, which is not being changed, appears to provide the protection being sought. No change has been made in response to the comment. 
COMMENT #5: Patti Herzog, employee of Blackburn & Elrod Orthodontists, voiced general opposition to the proposed rescission citing a need for truthful and honest advertising in dentistry. RESPONSE: The Missouri Dental Board appreciates Ms. Herzog’s input regarding the proposed rescission; however the board does not agree that this rule is necessary in fulfilling the board’s mission of protecting the public. Section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, prohibits den- tists from advertising in a way that is false, misleading, or deceptive to the public and provides examples of actions that are considered false, misleading, or deceptive.

COMMENT #7: James and Elizabeth Hester, voiced general opposi- tion to the proposed rescission citing a need for truthful and honest advertising in dentistry. RESPONSE: The Missouri Dental Board appreciates Mr. and Mrs. Hester’s input regarding the proposed rescission; however the board does not agree that this rule is necessary in fulfilling the board’s mis- sion of protecting the public. Section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, pro- hibits dentists from advertising in a way that is false, misleading, or deceptive to the public and provides examples of actions that are con- sidered false, misleading, or deceptive. The board does not believe that the public is truly further protected by this rule beyond the pro- tections provided in section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, against false, misleading, or deceptive advertisements.

Orders of Rulemaking 

Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2110—Missouri Dental Board Chapter 2—General Rules 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Dental Board under section 332.031, RSMo 2016, the board rescinds a rule as follows: 
20 CSR 2110-2.111 Addressing the Public—Dental Hygienists is rescinded. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the proposed rescission was published in the Missouri Register on January 2, 2018 (43 MoReg 10). No changes have been made in the proposed rescission, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed rescission becomes effec- tive thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended on February 2, 2018. The board received four (4) timely written comments in response to the proposed rescission. 
COMMENT #1: Dr. Michael G. Durbin, on behalf of the Missouri Society of Orthodontists (MSO) as well as the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO), voiced opposition to the proposed rescis- sion. Dr. Durbin’s concerns are that rescinding the rule would not provide a definition of what constitutes advertising so some dental hygienists may view certain communication mediums as non-adver- tising and advertise inappropriately to the public which could mis- lead the public. Dr. Durbin also expressed concern that rescinding the rule would allow dental hygienists to advertise their services directly to the public without the public knowing which dentist employs or supervises the dental hygienist. Dr. Durbin also expressed concern that rescinding the rule would remove the restric- tion prohibiting dental hygienists who are about to change employers from notifying patients that they are changing employers. Finally Dr. Durbin expressed concern that rescinding the rule could create a sit- uation where dental hygienists could publish dental health articles, messages, or newsletters in a manner that is false, misleading, or deceptive to the public by not truthfully disclosing the source and authorship, or designing the article to give rise to questionable expectations for the purpose of inducing the public to utilize the ser- vices of the sponsoring dental hygienist and/or the dentist who employs and/or supervises the hygienist. 
RESPONSE: The Missouri Dental Board appreciates Dr. Durbin’s input regarding the proposed rescission; however the board does not agree with his concerns. Section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, prohibits dental hygienists from advertising in a way that is false, misleading, or deceptive to the public and provides examples of actions that are considered false, misleading, or deceptive. While the statute does not contain a specific list defining that advertising means a communica- tion between a dental hygienist and the public and does not provide limited examples such as business cards, signs, web pages, Internet communications, radio, television, newspaper and magazine ads, the board feels like this is a simple common sense issue and that dental hygienists are able to recognize without such a definition that if they are communicating the availability of services to the public they are advertising. The board also does not agree that the requirement for advertisements from a dental hygienist to contain the name of the employing/supervising dentist is necessary for public protection. If the dental hygienist is working in a public health setting pursuant to section 332.311.2, RSMo, there is no employing/supervising dentist. The rule specifically allows dental hygienists working without an employing/supervising dentist pursuant to section 332.311.2, RSMo, to advertise their services while requiring the dental hygienist 
employed/supervised by a dentist to list that dentist. The board does not agree that one scenario is automatically false, misleading, or deceptive and the other is not. The board also does not agree that the restriction prohibiting dental hygienists from notifying patients that they are leaving one dental practice and joining another dental prac- tice is necessary for protection of the public. This restriction is clear- ly intended to protect the dentist whose employment the dental hygienist is leaving and not the public. The board argues that this restriction creates scenarios where patients will have gone to an office and seen a dental hygienist for their care and return to that office thinking that the same hygienist will be treating them only to find that someone else will now be providing their care. This sce- nario would seem to be much more false, misleading, and/or decep- tive to the public than a dental hygienist notifying patients that he/she will no longer be working at a particular office. Finally, the board does not agree that it is necessary to have a regulation defining a den- tal health article, message, or newsletter under a dental hygienists byline that does not make truthful disclosure of the author/source or is designed to give rise to questionable expectations for the purpose inducing the public to utilize a dentist’s/dental hygienist’s services as false, misleading, or deceptive. Basic logic would seem to indicate that an advertisement employing such tactics would be false, mislead- ing, or deceptive and therefore illegal in accordance with section 332.321.2(14), RSMo. The board does not believe that the public is truly further protected by this rule beyond the protections provided in section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, against false, misleading, or decep- tive advertisements. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in upholding a 2016 ruling against the Texas Dental Board affirmed a lower court’s ruling that restrictions against advertising a lawful activity in a way that was not misleading is a violation of First Amendment protected commercial free speech. There are restrictions in this rule that would seem to be problematic with that ruling and are not essential to the health, safety, or welfare of Missouri resi- dents. The board believes that this rule does not meet the criteria set forth in section 3(c) of Executive Order 17-03. Therefore in accor- dance with the explicit instructions of section 3(d) of the Executive Order, the board is seeking to rescind this rule. No change has been made in response to the comment. 
COMMENT #2: Vincent Rapini, D.D.S., on behalf of the Missouri Dental Association (MDA) voiced opposition to the proposed rescis- sion. Dr. Rapini stated that many of the concerns that he had with this proposed rescission were the same as concerns he is expressing with the proposed rescission of 20 CSR 2110-2.110. He did not list any of those specific concerns that applied to both proposals. Dr. Rapini did express specific concerns that rescinding the rule would remove the restriction prohibiting dental hygienists who are about to change employers from notifying patients that they are changing employers. Dr. Rapini stated that this could create situations where the dentist hiring away the hygienist may pay that hygienist to refer patients to the new employing dentist in violation of state and federal law. Dr. Rapini also expressed concern that rescinding the entire rule would eliminate the provision that prevents a dental hygienist from advertising without truthfully disclosing the source of authority of the information contained in dental health articles, messages, or newslet- ters. 
RESPONSE: The Missouri Dental Board appreciates Dr. Rapini’s input regarding the proposed rescission; however the board does not agree with his concerns. The first of the two (2) specific concerns Dr. Rapini expressed with this proposed rescission is that rescinding the rule could theoretically create situations where a dentist could pay a dental hygienist for referring new patients in violation of state and federal law. If the activity Dr. Rapini is concerned about is made ille- gal by both state and federal law, the board does not feel that the pub- lic is any further protected by the provision in the rule that Dr. Rapini is referring to. The board does not agree that the restriction prohibit- ing dental hygienists from notifying patients that they are leaving one dental practice and joining another dental practice is necessary for

protection of the public. This restriction seems clearly intended to protect the dentist whose employment the dental hygienist is leaving and not the public.

Basic logic would seem to indicate that an advertisement employing such tactics would be false, misleading, or deceptive and therefore illegal in accordance with section 332.321.2(14), RSMo. The board does not believe that the public is truly further protected by this rule beyond the protec- tions provided in section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, against false, mis- leading, or deceptive advertisements. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in upholding a 2016 ruling against the Texas Dental Board affirmed a lower court’s ruling that restrictions against advertising a lawful activity in a way that was not misleading is a violation of First Amendment protected commercial free speech.

Therefore in accor- dance with the explicit instructions of section 3(d) of the Executive Order, the board is seeking to rescind this rule. No change has been made in response to the comment. 
COMMENT #3: Orthodontist David Blackburn, D.M.D. voiced general opposition to the proposed rescission citing a need for truth- ful and honest advertising in dentistry. RESPONSE: The Missouri Dental Board appreciates Dr. Blackburn’s input regarding the proposed rescission; however the board does not agree that this rule is necessary in fulfilling the board’s mission of pro- tecting the public. Section 332.321.2(14), RSMo, prohibits dental hygienists from advertising in a way that is false, misleading, or decep- tive to the public and provides examples of actions that are considered false, misleading, or deceptive.

Therefore in accordance with the explicit instructions of section 3(d) of the Executive Order, the board is seeking to rescind this rule. No change has been made in response to the comment. 
COMMENT #4: Orthodontist Neil Kanning, D.M.D. voiced general opposition to the proposed rescission citing a need for truthful and honest advertising in dentistry. RESPONSE: The Missouri Dental Board appreciates Dr. Blackburn’s input regarding the proposed rescission; however the board does not agree that this rule is necessary in fulfilling the board’s mission of pro- tecting the public.

Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2110—Missouri Dental Board Chapter 2—General Rules 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Dental Board under section 332.031, RSMo 2016, the board rescinds a rule as follows: 
20 CSR 2110-2.140 Notice, Change of Employment—Dental Hygienists is rescinded. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the proposed rescission was published in the Missouri Register on January 2, 2018 (43 MoReg 11). No changes have been made in the proposed rescission, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed rescission becomes effec- tive thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The board received one (1) com- ment in response to the proposed rescission. 
COMMENT #1: Dr. Michael G. Durbin, on behalf of the Missouri Society of Orthodontists (MSO) as well as the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) voiced opposition to the proposed rescission. Dr. Durbin’s concerns are that rescinding the rule requiring a dentist to report to the Missouri Dental Board whenever that dentist hires a dental hygienist or a dental hygienist leaves the dentist’s employment could lead to an unlicensed dental hygienist easily being hired by a dentist. Dr. Durbin also expressed concern that rescinding the rule could enable non-dentists who are providing dental services to employ a dental hygienist without the board knowing about it. RESPONSE: The Missouri Dental Board appreciates Dr. Durbin’s input regarding the proposed rescission; however, the board does not agree with his concerns. As Dr. Durbin points out in his comments, the original purpose of this rule was to insure “to dentist employing a dental hygienist that the hygienist is registered and currently licensed.” This rule became effective on January 12, 1976. At that time, the only method a dentist wishing to employ a new dental hygienist had for verifying that a dental hygienist was licensed was to contact the board. Since 1976, significant technological advances have been developed, such as the internet, that now enable a dentist to verify that a dental hygienist is licensed without the necessity of making a report to the board. The rule is unnecessary and outdated due to this technology and unduly burdensome by requiring dentists to make a report that is no longer needed. As to Dr. Durbin’s concern that a non-dentist entity may be illegally employing a dental hygienist without the board’s knowledge, the board points out that the existing rule would not seem to address that concern as it only requires den- tists employing a dental hygienist to make the required report to the board. The board thinks that it is unlikely that an entity who is attempting to illegally employ someone would make a report to the board of that intention. No change has been made in response to the comment.

20 CSR 2110-2.150 Dental Practices is rescinded. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the proposed rescission was published in the Missouri Register on January 2, 2018 (43 MoReg 11). No changes have been made in the proposed rescission, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed rescission becomes effec- tive thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The board received one (1) com- ment in response to the proposed rescission. 
COMMENT #1: Dr. Michael G. Durbin, on behalf of the Missouri Society of Orthodontists (MSO) as well as the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO), voiced opposition to the proposed rescis- sion. Dr. Durbin points out that the existing rule limits the ways that a dentist may practice his or her profession to sole proprietorships, partnerships, professional dental corporations, or dental limited lia- bility companies. Dr. Durbin also expressed concern that rescinding the rule would remove requirements for how dentists name their practices. 
RESPONSE: The Missouri Dental Board appreciates Dr. Durbin’s input regarding the proposed rescission; however, the board does not agree with his concerns. Section 332.081, RSMo, regulates what entities may own a dental practice in Missouri such as professional corporations, not-for-profit corporations, hospitals, etc. The board does not feel that Missouri citizens are any better protected by a rule placing additional restrictions on how a dental practice is to be orga- nized. Additionally, the board does not feel that Missouri citizens are any better protected by a rule requiring that the name of a dental practice must include a dentists name and the degree title D.D.S. or D.M.D. This name requirement would seem to prohibit a dentist from using a more customized name such as Jefferson City Orthodontics. The board feels that the regulations and restrictions in this rule represent exactly the type of heavy handed big government over reach that Executive Order 17-03 is attempting to curtail. The board believes that this rule does not meet the criteria set forth in sec- tion 3(c) of Executive Order 17-03. Therefore in accordance with the explicit instructions of section 3(d) of the Executive Order, the board is seeking to rescind this rule. No change has been made in response to the comment.
