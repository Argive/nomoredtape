HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO 
RULES 
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system– 
Title Division Chapter Rule 
3 CSR 10- 4 .115 Department Code of Agency General area Specific area 
State Division regulated regulated Regulations 
and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115. 
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a. 
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation, for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115 NOT Rule 10-4.115. Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated. 
Code and Register on the Internet 
The Code of State Regulations and Missouri Register are available on the Internet. The Code address is www.sos.mo.gov/adrules/csr/csr The Register address is www.sos.mo.gov/adrules/moreg/moreg These websites contain rulemakings and regulations as they appear in the Code and Registers.

Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]

Title 7—DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Division 10—Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission Chapter 24—Design-Build Project Contracts 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
7 CSR 10-24.050 Types of Projects in Which Design-Build Con- tracting May Be Used. The Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission is amending the purpose statement and section (1), and deleting sections (2) through (5). 
PURPOSE: This amendment is to bring us in compliance with cur- rent federal guidance. 
PURPOSE: This rule provides for the types of projects in which design-build method may be used [in determining a project “qual- ified” and how it applies to Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) projects]. 
(1) Subject to the provisions of 227.107, RSMo [Supp. 2004], the design-build contracting technique may be used for any [qualified or nonqualified] project which the commission deems to be appropri- ate on the basis of project delivery time, cost, construction schedule, and/or quality. 
[(2) The use of the term “qualified project” does not limit the use of design-build contracting by the commission. It merely determines the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA’s) procedures for approval. The division administrator may approve the design-build method for a “qualified project” which meets the requirements of this chapter. 
(3) The FHWA division administrator may also approve other design-build projects (which do not meet the “qualified pro- jects” definition) by using Special Experimental Projects No. 14 (SEP-14), “Innovative Contracting Practices,” provided the project meets the requirements of this chapter. Projects that do not meet the requirements of this chapter, (either “qualified or nonqualified” projects) must be submitted to the FHWA for conceptual approval. 
(4) As a consequence of these differences in FHWA proce- dures, Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) pro- cedures will vary to comply with FHWA procedures. 
(5) For the purpose of this chapter, a federal-aid ITS design- build project meets the criteria of a “qualified project” if: 
(A) A majority of the scope of services provides ITS ser- vices (at least fifty percent (50%) of the scope of work is related to ITS services); and 
(B) The estimated contract value exceeds five (5) million dollars.]

(9) Final Proposal Revisions as a Result of Discussions. (A) The commission may request or allow final proposal revisions to clarify and document understandings reached during discussions. At the conclusion of discussions, each proposer [shall be given an 
opportunity to] may submit a final proposal revision in writing. (B) The commission will establish a common cut-off date only for receipt of final proposal revisions. [Requests for final proposal revisions shall advise proposers that the final proposal revi- sions shall be in writing and of the intent to make award 
without obtaining further revisions.] 
(10) The commission may further narrow the competitive range if a proposer originally in the competitive range is no longer considered to be among the most highly rated proposers being considered for award. That proposer may be eliminated from the competitive range whether or not all material aspects of the proposal have been discussed, or whether or not the proposer has been afforded an opportunity to sub- mit a proposal revision. The [C]commission will provide a proposer excluded from the competitive range with a written determination and notice that proposal revisions will not be considered. 
(11) The commission may determine a need to hold more than one (1) round of discussions with proposers, but only at the conclusion of dis- cussions will the proposers be requested to submit a final proposal revi- sion, also called best and final offer (BAFO). Thus, regardless of the length or number of discussions, there will be only one (1) request for a final revised proposal (i.e., only one (1) BAFO) with the intent to make award without obtaining further revisions.

PURPOSE: This amendment alleviates the burden on supervising physicians and physician assistants. 
(1) As used in this rule, unless specifically provided otherwise, the term—

Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 70—MO HealthNet Division Chapter 10—Nursing Home Program

A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on October 2, 2017 (42 MoReg 1377–1381).

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: No comments were received. 
Title 19—DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SENIOR SERVICES Division 30—Division of Regulation and Licensure Chapter 81—Certification 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services under sections 192.006, 192.2000, and 198.079, RSMo 2016, the department amends a rule as follows: 
19 CSR 30-81.030 Evaluation and Assessment Measures for Title XIX Recipients and Applicants in Long-Term Care Facilities is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on August 15, 2017 (42 MoReg 1197–1201). No changes have been made in the text of the proposed amendment, so it is not reprinted here. This pro- posed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Department of Health and Senior Services received six (6) comments from the Missouri Alliance for Home Care (MAHC) and Pyramid Group. 
COMMENT #1: The MAHC and Pyramid Group both commented on the potential risk and impact to current Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) participants with a current Level of Care (LOC) of twenty-one (21) if they are no longer able to receive HCBS. Potential impacts included a decline in health condition and the risk of entering a skilled nursing facility. 
RESPONSE: No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #2: The MAHC and Pyramid Group commented that the estimated fiscal impact was flawed. Loss of HCBS could lead to increased hospitalizations or entry into skilled nursing facilities both at a higher cost to the state. 
RESPONSE: Data is not available to provide a fiscal note that is more specific. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #3: The MAHC commented that a transition plan and health and welfare protections were not included in this amendment. The comment stated this was in violation of 42 CFR 441.302(a). RESPONSE: 42 CFR 441.302(a) is a requirement related to infor- mation that must be submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services when amending 1915c waivers. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #4: The MAHC commented that the regulation amend- ment is arbitrary and violates due process. RESPONSE: Existing regulations provide for an administrative hear- ing process for HCBS participants affected by the LOC change. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENTS #5: The MAHC commented that the LOC point change does not change the HCBS participant’s already established need for services. RESPONSE: Level of care eligibility for HCBS is a point in time assessment per federal guidelines. States are given the authority through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to develop LOC parameters and assessment tools and to adjust those as needed. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #6: The MAHC commented that the amendment is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). They stated that individuals may be at risk to enter a more restrictive setting and that public entities are required to provide community-based services for persons with disabilities who would otherwise be entitled to insti- tutional services. 
RESPONSE: The department does not agree. An individual not qual- ifying for Medicaid HCBS would also not qualify for Medicaid Skilled Nursing Facility Placement. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment.
