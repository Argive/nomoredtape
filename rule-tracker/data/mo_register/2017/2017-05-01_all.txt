Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 30—Animal Health Chapter 10—Food Safety and Meat Inspection 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 2 CSR 30-10.010 Inspection of Meat and Poultry. The director is 
amending section (2). 
PURPOSE: This amendment ensures that the current rule language clearly includes the most recent publication date of Part 300 to the end of Title 9, the Code of Federal Regulations for the Missouri Meat and Poultry Inspection Program to be in compliance with the federal regulations and maintain “equal to” status as determined by the United States Department of Agriculture/Food Safety and Inspection Service. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: This emergency amendment is neces- sary to maintain the Missouri Meat and Poultry Inspection Program’s (MMPIP) continued compliance with federally mandated meat inspection standards. The MMPIP is required to operate in a manner and with authorities that are “at least equal to” the antemortem and postmortem inspection, re-inspection, sanitation, recordkeeping, and enforcement provisions of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act. The state of Missouri must stay cur- rent with federal meat and poultry laws and regulations. Therefore, this emergency amendment clarifies that the most current federal meat and poultry inspection regulations and enforcement authorities 
are incorporated by reference in Missouri. MMPIP regulates approx- imately thirty-six (36) state inspected meat and poultry establish- ments and one hundred fifty-five (155) custom exempt plants in Missouri, which as a whole, contributes millions of dollars to Missouri’s economy. This emergency amendment protects the public health, safety, and welfare under a compelling governmental interest, by maintaining the state of Missouri’s, through the MMPIP,“at least equal to” federally mandated meat inspection standards which requires this emergency action. A proposed amendment, which covers the same material, is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. The scope of this emergency amendment is limited to the circum- stances creating the emergency and complies with the protection extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The Department of Agriculture believes this emergency amendment is fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency amendment was filed March 24, 2017, becomes effective April 3, 2017, and expires January 10, 2018. 
(2) The standards used to inspect Missouri meat and poultry slaugh- ter and processing shall be those shown in Part 300 to end of Title 9, the Code of Federal Regulations (January [2016] 2017), herein incorporated by reference and made a part of this rule as published by the United States Superintendent of Documents, 732 N Capitol Street NW, Washington, DC 20402-0001, phone: toll-free (866) 512- 1800, DC area (202) 512-1800, website: http://bookstore.gpo.gov. This rule does not incorporate any subsequent amendments or addi- tions. 
AUTHORITY: section 265.020, RSMo [2000] 2016. Original rule filed Sept. 14, 2000, effective March 30, 2001. For intervening histo- ry, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Emergency amend- ment filed March 24, 2017, effective April 3, 2017, expires Jan. 10, 2018. A proposed amendment covering this same material is pub- lished in this issue of the Missouri Register. 
Title 19—DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SENIOR SERVICES Division 30—Division of Regulation and Licensure Chapter 40—Comprehensive Emergency Medical Services Systems Regulations 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 
19 CSR 30-40.309 Application and Licensure Requirements Standards for the Licensure and Relicensure of Ground Ambulance Services. The department is amending subsection (2)(A). 
PURPOSE: This amendment adds the Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services Ground Vehicle Standard for Ambulances v.1.0 edition and the National Fire Protection Association 1917 Standard for Automotive Ambulances 2016 edition as acceptable standards/specifications for vehicles specifically designed, manufac- tured, and equipped for use as an ambulance. 
PUBLISHER’S NOTE: The secretary of state has determined that the publication of the entire text of the material which is incorporated by reference as a portion of this rule would be unduly cumbersome or expensive. This material as incorporated by reference in this rule shall be maintained by the agency at its headquarters and shall be made available to the public for inspection and copying at no more than the actual cost of reproduction. This note applies only to the ref- erence material. The entire text of the rule is printed here. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: Currently, the Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) requires all ambulances to be designed,

Emergency Rules 

manufactured, and equipped to the United States Department of Transportation KKK-A-1822 standards/specifications. As of October 31, 2016, the United States General Services Administration ceased to support the United States Department of Transportation KKK-A-1822 standards/specifications meaning that the KKK-A-1822 standards/spec- ifications for the ambulances will no longer be updated by the United States Department of Transportation and new ambulances cannot be designed, manufactured, and equipped to the United States Department of Transportation KKK-A-1822 standards/specifications. Therefore, the DHSS is adding the Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services Ground Vehicle Standard for Ambulances v.1.0 edition and the National Fire Protection Association 1917 Standard for Automotive Ambulances 2016 edition as acceptable standards/specifications for new vehicles specifically designed, manu- factured, and equipped for use as an ambulance. This will allow ground ambulance services licensed with the DHSS to be able to buy new ambulances which meet these new standards/specifications since new ambulances can no longer be designed, manufactured, and equipped to the United States Department of Transportation KKK-A- 1822 standards/specifications. There are currently two hundred eigh- teen (218) ground ambulance services licensed by DHSS. There are approximately one thousand eighty (1080) ambulances located in these two hundred eighteen (218) ground ambulance services. On average, ambulances need to be replaced by ambulance services every five (5) years. This emergency amendment is necessary in order for ground ambulance services licensed by DHSS to be able to buy new ambulances that meet the DHSS’s approval. The emergency amendment is also necessary to ensure that new ambulances meet appropriate standards/specifications to protect the safety of both the patient and the staff riding in these ambulances. As a result, the DHSS finds an immediate danger to the public health, safety, and/or welfare and a compelling governmental interest, which requires this emergency action. A proposed amendment, which covers the same material, is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. The scope of this emergency amendment is limited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and the United States Constitutions. The DHSS believes this emergency amendment is fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency amendment was filed March 16, 2017, becomes effective March 26, 2017, and expires January 3, 2018. 
(2) Each vehicle operated as an ambulance shall meet the following vehicle design, specification, operation, and maintenance standards: (A) Vehicle Design and Specification Standards. In providing the transportation of patients, ambulance services shall utilize only vehi- cles specifically designed, manufactured, and equipped for use as an ambulance and which meet current (at date of vehicle manufacture) standards/specifications set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation KKK-A-1822 [specifications with exceptions of the following:], the Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services Ground Vehicle Standard for Ambulances v.1.0 edition or the National Fire Protection Association 1917 Standard for Automotive Ambulances 2016 Edition. The Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services Ground Vehicle Standard for Ambulances v.1.0 edition is incorporated by reference in this rule as published in 2016 and is available at the Ground Vehicle Standard, 1926 Waukegan Road Suite 300, Glenview Il 60025- 1770. This rule does not incorporate any subsequent amendments or additions. The National Fire Protection Association 1917 Standard for Automotive Ambulances 2016 Edition is incorporated by reference in this rule as published in 2016 and is available at the National Fire Protection Association, 1 Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02169-7471. This rule does not incorporate any sub- sequent amendments or additions. Exceptions to these stan- 
dards/specifications may include the following: 
1. Image elements (such as paint) may be altered to the agency’s preference; 
2. Variation of warning lights is allowed for: type and color of lens, strobe lights in lieu of halogen lights, additional warning lights beyond the U.S. Department of Transportation KKK-A-1822, National Fire Protection Association 1917 Standard for Automotive Ambulances 2016 edition or the Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services Ground Vehicle Standard for Ambulances v.1.0 edition specifications;

Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2220—State Board of Pharmacy Chapter 4—Fees Charged by the Board of Pharmacy 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2220-4.010 General Fees. The Board of Pharmacy is propos- 
ing to add section (5). 
PURPOSE: The Board of Pharmacy is statutorily obligated to enforce and administer the provisions of Chapter 338, RSMo, governing the practice of pharmacy. Pursuant to section 338.070, RSMo, the board shall set the appropriate amount of fees by rule, so that the revenue produced shall not substantially exceed the cost and expense of administering the provisions of Chapter 338, RSMo. Based on the board’s five- (5-) year projections, the board finds it necessary to reduce renewal fees for Missouri pharmacies and drug distributors. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The Board of Pharmacy is statutorily obligated to set all fees, by regulation, necessary to administer the provisions of Chapter 338, RSMo. Pursuant to section 338.070, RSMo, the board shall set the appropriate amount of fees by rule, so that the revenue produced shall not substantially exceed the cost and expense of administering the provisions of Chapter 338, RSMo. Therefore, the board is proposing to decrease 2017 renewal fees for Missouri pharmacies and drug distributors from four hundred fifty dollars ($450) to one hundred fifty dollars ($150). Pharmacy and drug distributor renewal notices will be mailed on August 1, 2017. Without this emergency amendment, the decreased fee requirements will not be effective prior to renewal notices being mailed, and the board will collect more revenue than it is statutorily authorized to collect. The scope of the emergency amendment is limited to the cir- cumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. In devel- oping this emergency amendment, the board has determined that the fee decrease is necessary for the 2017 renewal period to prevent funds from exceeding the maximum fund balance thereby resulting in a transfer from the fund to general revenue as set forth in section 338.070.3, RSMo. Pursuant to section 324.001.10, RSMo, a com- pelling governmental interest is deemed to exist for the purposes of section 536.025, RSMo, for licensure fees to be reduced by emer- gency rule, if the projected fund balance of any agency assigned to

the Division of Professional Registration is reasonably expected to exceed an amount that would require transfer from that fund to gen- eral revenue. The board believes this emergency amendment to be fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency amendment was filed April 11 2017, becomes effective April 21, 2017, and expires December 1, 2017. 
(5) To ensure compliance with section 338.070, RSMo, the follow- ing renewal fees shall be effective from August 1, 2017 to October 31, 2017: 
(A) Pharmacy Distributor/Wholesale Drug Distributor License Renewal Fee $150 (B) Pharmacy Permit Renewal Fee $150

MISSOURI Proposed Rules May 1, 2017 REGISTER Vol. 42, No. 9 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the State Board of Education (board) under sections 161.092, 168.021, and 168.400, RSMo 2016, the board hereby adopts a rule as follows: 
5 CSR 20-400.385 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on December 1, 2016 (41 MoReg 1802–1803). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The board received seven (7) com- ments on this proposed rule. Five (5) of the comments were focused on the timeline for the Beginning Teacher Assistance Program (BTAP). The board received two (2) comments from Southeast Missouri State University focused on their role. 
COMMENT #1: Carlos Vargas, President of Southeast Missouri State University, and Diana Rogers-Adkinson, President, Missouri Association of Colleges of Teacher Education (MACTE), propose that the language “sponsored by a Missouri teacher education pro- gram” be deleted from the rule or that the rule be withdrawn or sus- pended at this time. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The board reviewed the comments and agrees that since legislation (Excellence in Education Act 1985, section 168.400.4(1) & .5 RSMo) states that Missouri teacher education programs would assist in BTAP, the lan- guage in section (1) will be changed to reflect the legislation. The new revised language will indicate “with assistance from a teacher education program.” 
COMMENT #2: Ann Jarrett, Missouri National Education Association (MNEA), Paula York, American Federation of Teachers (AFT), Kathy Steinhoff, MNEA, Holly Bennett, MNEA, and Doug Mirts, Missouri Association of Secondary School Principals (MoASSP), proposed that language be added to section (1) to reflect that a “BTAP is designed for teachers in either their first or second year of teaching.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The board reviewed the comments and agrees changing section (1) would lead to greater clarification for districts and also aligns with the Mentoring Program Standards. 
COMMENT #3: Ann Jarrett, MNEA, Paula York, AFT, Kathy Steinhoff, MNEA, Holly Bennett, MNEA, and Doug Mirts, MoASSP, commented that it is important for beginning teachers to 
complete the BTAP in their initial year of teaching, but that realisti- cally this may not occur due to a multitude of reasons. They proposed that language be changed in section (2) to ensure that teachers new to the profession, those coming from other states, and those that are uninformed, would not be penalized if they were unable to complete the BTAP in the initial contract year. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The board reviewed the comments and agrees that the language should be changed to ensure that teachers are not hindered in obtaining their Career Continuous Certificate due to completing the BTAP in year two (2), three (3), or four (4). Language was removed in section (2) which indicated that it should be completed during the first year. 
5 CSR 20-400.385 Beginning Teacher Assistance Program 
(1) All new teachers are required to participate in a beginning teacher assistance program (BTAP) planned with assistance from a Missouri teacher education program and provided by an education association, regional service center, school district, or charter school. The BTAP is designed for teachers in either their first or second year of teach- ing. The minimum requirements for the program shall include, but not be limited to, an overview of the topics listed below: 
(A) Classroom Environment— 1. Classroom management techniques; 2. Time, space, transitions, and activities management; and 3. Awareness of diverse classroom, school and community cul- 
tures; (B) Student Engagement and Motivation— 
1. Effective instruction; 2. Clear learning goals and/or objectives; 3. Student voice and choice; and 4. Teaching and learning activities with high student engage- 
ment; (C) Professional Communication— 
1. Effective communication with students, mentors, colleagues, and parents; 
2. Verbal and nonverbal communication techniques; and 
3. Effective use of technology and social media for communica- tion; and 
(D) Education-Related Law— 1. Certification requirements; 2. Professional rights and responsibilities; and 3. Self-assessment and professional learning. 
(2) An effective program is aligned with professional development/growth plans focused on teaching standards and indica- tors as priorities for the first two (2) years of teaching, and provides on-going support during the years of BTAP.

Title 4—DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Division 340—Division of Energy Chapter 2—Energy Loan Program 
IN ADDITION Notification: Applications accepted between May 1, 2017 and July 
31, 2017 for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Loan Cycle. 
The Missouri Department of Economic Development’s (department) Division of Energy is making available approximately five (5) million dollars in loan financing for qualified energy efficiency and renew- able energy projects. Energy-saving investments may include projects such as insulation, lighting systems, heating and cooling systems, combined heat and power, pumps, motors, aerators, renewable ener- gy systems, and other measures that reduce energy use and cost. Recipients repay loans with money saved on energy costs. 
Eligible Energy-Using Sectors: Loan funds will be allocated to eli- gible energy-using sectors as follows: 
• Public Schools (K–12): twenty-five percent (25%) of available funds; 
• Public and Private Higher Education Institutions: twenty-five percent (25%) of available funds; 
• Public and Private not-for-profit Hospitals: twenty-five percent (25%) of available funds; and 
• Local Governments: twenty-five percent (25%) of available funds. Local governments include a county, city, or village (which may include water treatment plants or waste water facil- ities), local government/public owned airport facilities (munic- ipal, county, regional, and international); or any hospital dis- trict as defined in section 206.010, RSMo; or any sewer district as defined in section 249.010, RSMo; or any water supply dis- tricts as defined in section 247.010, RSMo; or any ambulance district as defined in section 190.010, RSMo; or any sub-dis- trict of a zoological park and museum district as defined in sec- tion 184.352, RSMo. 
Application Procedures: An application for loan funds may be sub- mitted to the department for the purpose of financing all or a portion of the cost of implementing an energy-saving project. 
Each applicant may apply for a loan not to exceed one (1) million dollars. Loan applications will not be considered for less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or with a payback score of less than six (6) months. 
If funds remain after review and priority ranking of applications, the department will consider awarding loans in excess of one (1) million dollars. 
Requests for loan financing must be made using the Division of Energy’s Energy Loan Program Application Authorization Form, Fuel Use Summary Form, and Energy Conservation Measure Summary 
Form. Application forms and instructions are available on the depart- ment’s website: http://energyloan.mo.gov. 
The Application Authorization Form must be signed and dated by an authorized official. An authorized official is an individual with authority to obligate an eligible applicant to the terms of loan agree- ment and promissory note to repay loan proceeds. 
A paper or electronic copy of the signed original Application Authorization Form and required documents may be submitted to the department’s address below. 
Applications received after July 31, 2017 will not be considered for a loan award for this 2018 cycle but may be held for consideration during subsequent application cycles. 
The department may request additional information as needed to determine the feasibility of a project, the project’s estimated annual energy savings, and financial risks of a loan transaction. Also, an energy conservation measure has the potential of affecting other areas within the facility or system. Applicants must have no outstanding actions for violations of applicable federal, state, or local laws, ordi- nances, and rules. 
Interest Rates: Loan principal plus two and three quarters percent (2.75%) interest is to be repaid to the department in semi-annual pay- ments not to exceed a ten- (10-) year repayment period. An adminis- trative fee of one percent (1%) of loan principal will be added to the repayment amount. 
Selection Criteria: Recipients of loan financing will be determined on a competitive basis. Applications will be ranked based on the pro- ject’s payback score, which is determined by dividing the cost to implement a project by the estimated yearly energy cost savings. Projects with the lowest payback score in each sector allocation will be funded until all available funds are allocated. If all funds are not allocated in any one (1) sector after ranking payback scores, the department may allocate funds to other sectors. Loan applications will be approved or disapproved by October 31, 2017.

Background 
The individuals listed in this notice have recently filed applications requesting MoDOT to issue SPE Certificates to exempt them from the physical qualification requirements relating to vision in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(10), or to diabetes in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(3), which other- wise apply to drivers of CMVs in Missouri intrastate commerce.
