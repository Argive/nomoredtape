Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 15—ELECTED OFFICIALS Division 30—Secretary of State Chapter 110—Notary Use of Electronic Signatures and Seals 
EMERGENCY RULE 15 CSR 30-110.010 Electronic Notary Definitions 
PURPOSE: This rule provides definitions pertaining to the use of electronic signatures and seals by notaries. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: This emergency rule is necessary to address statutory sections enacted in SB 932 (2016), specifically sec- tion 486.275.2, which became law on August 28, 2016. This legisla- tion provides that electronic signatures may now be used to satisfy certain acts currently performed by notaries in Missouri using origi- nal signatures. Section 486.275.2, RSMo states that “if a signature or record is required to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, notwithstanding the provisions of section 486.285 to the contrary, the requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the person authorized to perform such acts, together with all other information required to be included, is attached to or logically asso- ciated with the signature or record.” Unfortunately, this section pro- vides no further guidance or direction to any Missouri notary public who may wish to utilize electronic signatures or electronic seals in the performance of notarial acts. To provide such direction to 
Missouri notaries, extensive research into e-notarization was com- pleted in developing this rule. From August 2016 to October of 2016, all current Missouri notary regulations were reviewed as well as other e-notarization laws and administrative rules throughout the United States. State administrators of e-notary systems in three (3) different states, the National Notary Association, and American Society of Notaries were consulted. After these consultations, conference calls with stakeholders active in the passage of SB 932 took place. These stakeholders were then provided with draft rules to be reviewed. Throughout October through December of 2016, the feedback from stakeholders regarding the draft rules was collected and was taken into account in producing updated language. Without this emergency rule in place, notaries wanting to use an electronic signature will be forced to proceed without any direction from the State of Missouri. Providing guidance will be beneficial to notaries who wish to complete important transactions in Missouri with electronic signatures. As such, the Office of the Secretary of State finds a compelling governmental interest to provide notaries public with guidance in the form of minimum stan- dards and procedures as soon as possible utilizing an emergency rule. The scope of this emergency rule is limited to the circumstances creat- ing the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. After reviewing laws and regulations pertaining to this subject matter in other states and after communicating with numerous stakeholders within Missouri, the Office of the Secretary of State believes this emergency rule is fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emer- gency rule was filed December 21, 2016, becomes effective December 31, 2016, and expires February 23, 2017. 
(1) The following definitions, except where inconsistent with Chapter 486, RSMo, shall mean: 
(A) “Capable of independent verification” means that any interest- ed person may confirm the validity of a notary public’s identity and authority through a publicly accessible system; 
(B) “Electronic” means relating to technology having electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic, or similar capa- bilities; 
(C) “Electronic signature” means a symbol that is executed with technology having electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic, or similar capabilities and is attached to or logically associated with an electronic record and is executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record; 
(D) “Electronic seal” means an electronic representation of a notary’s seal; 
(E) “Electronic notarial certificate” means the portion of a nota- rized electronic document that is completed by the notary public, bears the notary public’s electronic signature and electronic seal, and meets all other statutory requirements of this state regarding notarial certificates; 
(F) “Principal” means an individual whose signature is notarized, or an individual, other than a witness required for the electronic nota- rization, taking an oath or affirmation from the notary public; 
(G) “Record” means information that is inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form; and 
(H) “Sole control” means at all times being in the direct physical custody of the notary public or safeguarded by the notary with a pass- word or other secure means of authentication. 
AUTHORITY: section 486.275, RSMo 2016. Emergency rule filed Dec. 21, 2016, effective Dec. 31, 2016, expires Feb. 23, 2017. A pro- posed rule covering this same material is published in this issue of the Missouri Register.

Emergency Rules 

Title 15—ELECTED OFFICIALS Division 30—Secretary of State Chapter 110—Notary Use of Electronic Signatures and Seals 
EMERGENCY RULE 15 CSR 30-110.020 Electronic Signatures and Seals 
PURPOSE: This rule describes the process for notary use of elec- tronic signatures and seals. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: This emergency rule is necessary to address statutory sections enacted in SB 932 (2016), specifically sec- tion 486.275.2, which became law on August 28, 2016. This legisla- tion provides that electronic signatures may now be used to satisfy cer- tain acts currently performed by notaries in Missouri using original signatures. Section 486.275.2, RSMo states that “if a signature or record is required to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, notwithstanding the provisions of section 486.285 to the contrary, the requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the person authorized to perform such acts, together with all other infor- mation required to be included, is attached to or logically associated with the signature or record.” Unfortunately, this section provides no further guidance or direction to any Missouri notary public who may wish to utilize electronic signatures or electronic seals in the perfor- mance of notarial acts. To provide such direction to Missouri notaries, extensive research into e-notarization was completed in developing this rule. From August 2016 to October of 2016, all current Missouri notary regulations were reviewed as well as other e-notarization laws and administrative rules throughout the United States. State administrators of e-notary systems in three (3) different states, the National Notary Association, and American Society of Notaries were consulted. After these consultations, conference calls with stakeholders active in the passage of SB 932 took place. These stakeholders were then provided with draft rules to be reviewed. Throughout October through December of 2016, the feedback from stakeholders regarding the draft rules was collected and was taken into account in producing updated language. Without this emergency rule in place, notaries wanting to use an electronic signature will be forced to proceed without any direc- tion from the State of Missouri. Providing guidance will be beneficial to notaries who wish to complete important transactions in Missouri with electronic signatures. As such, the Office of the Secretary of State finds a compelling governmental interest to provide notaries public with guidance in the form of minimum standards and procedures as soon as possible utilizing an emergency rule. The scope of this emer- gency rule is limited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. After reviewing laws and regulations pertaining to this subject matter in other states and after communicating with numerous stakeholders within Missouri, the Office of the Secretary of State believes this emergency rule is fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency rule was filed December 21, 2016, becomes effective December 31, 2016, and expires February 23, 2017. 
(1) A notary may use an electronic seal in the performance of a notarial act. 
(2) Any notary who wishes to use an electronic signature and seal in the performance of a notarial act must provide written notice to the Commissions Division of the Missouri Secretary of State’s Office prior to that notary’s first such use. 
(3) In using an electronic signature and seal in the performance of a notarial act, the notary public must adhere to all applicable laws of this state that apply to notaries public. 
(4) If a notarial act requires an electronic record to be signed, the principal must appear in person before the notary public. 
(5) A notary public must keep in the sole control of the notary any system used to produce the notary’s electronic signature and seal. 
(6) The electronic signature and seal of a notary public shall contain the notary’s name exactly as indicated on the notary’s commission, and the electronic seal must contain all elements of a notary seal required by law and meet all other statutory requirements of this state regarding notary seals. 
(7) A notary’s electronic signature must be identical to the signatures on file with the secretary of state. 
(8) If an electronic signature or seal is used in the performance of a notarial act, a notary public shall complete an electronic notarial cer- tificate that is attached or logically associated with the notary’s elec- tronic signature and seal. 
(9) An electronic signature shall be capable of independent verifica- tion. 
AUTHORITY: section 486.275, RSMo 2016. Emergency rule filed Dec. 21, 2016, effective Dec. 31, 2016, expires Feb. 23, 2017. A pro- posed rule covering this same material is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. 
Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2015—Acupuncturist Advisory Committee Chapter 1—General Rules 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2015-1.030 Fees. The advisory committee is proposing to 
amend subsection (3)(B). 
PURPOSE: The advisory committee is statutorily obligated to enforce and administer the provisions of sections 324.475–324.499, RSMo. Pursuant to section 324.481, RSMo, the Missouri State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, upon recommendation of the Acupuncturist Advisory Committee, shall set fees necessary to admin- ister the provisions of sections 324.475–324.499, RSMo. The adviso- ry committee is proposing to decrease the practitioner renewal fee. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The Missouri State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, upon the recommendation of the Acupuncturist Advisory Committee, is statutorily obligated to set all fees, by regulation, necessary to administer the provisions of sections 324.475–324.499, RSMo. Pursuant to section 324.481, RSMo, the advisory committee shall, by regulation, set the amount of fees authorized by sections 324.475–324.499, RSMo, to produce revenue which shall not substantially exceed the cost and expense of admin- istering the provisions of sections 324.475–324.499, RSMo. Therefore, the board, upon recommendation by the advisory commit- tee, is proposing to decrease the biennial renewal fee from one hun- dred twenty-five dollars ($125) to fifty dollars ($50) for the 2017 renewal period. 
The acupuncturist license expires on June 30, 2017. The renewal notices for acupuncturists will be mailed April 1, 2017, and any acupuncturist wishing to reinstate or renew their license beginning April 1, 2017 will be assessed the decreased renewal fee. Without this emergency amendment the decreased fee requirement will not be effective in time for the renewal notice, and the advisory committee will collect more revenue than it is statutorily authorized to collect.

The potential impact of HB 2615, passed by the Kansas legislature and signed into law in 2016, must be considered. The Kansas Acupuncture Practice Act includes a “grandfather clause” waiving formal education defined by rule, as well as the national examina- tion. To be eligible for licensure, according to the Kansas grandfa- ther clause, an application must be submitted prior to July 1, 2018, and the applicant must complete at least one thousand three hundred fifty (1,350) hours of acupuncture study prior to July 1, 2017. Additionally, the applicant must document one thousand five hundred (1,500) patient visits spanning three (3) of the last five (5) years prior to July 1, 2017. Finally, the law includes a provision for a licensed acupuncturist from another state to be eligible for Kansas licensure. As a result of Kansas licensing acupuncturist, Missouri could expe- rience a decrease in the number of licensees but the impact is unknown. 
Acupuncturists have been licensed in this state since 2001. Using the original issue date of a license and licensee address, the advisory committee identified practitioners who could potentially meet the years of practice timeline of the Kansas grandfather clause. An overview of the distribution of licensees in and near Kansas is as fol- lows: one hundred thirty-seven (137) current licensees; fifteen (15) current licensees have a Kansas mailing address; nine (9) of these current licensees potentially meet the timeframe parameters of the Kansas grandfather clause. Eighteen (18) current licensees live in the Kansas City area and potentially meet the timeframe parameters of the grandfather clause of the Kansas licensure law. 
Various renewal fee reduction scenarios were reviewed, to include a renewal fee of one hundred dollars ($100), seventy-five dollars ($75), and fifty dollars ($50). It is uncertain how many Missouri licensees will maintain licensure in this state and instead opt for the Kansas license. Similarly, it is uncertain if Missouri will annually continue to receive the same number of new applications for licen- sure. Because of this unknown potential impact upon licensure renewals and applications, the Advisory Committee and State Board of Chiropractic Examiners is requesting an emergency rule with a one- (1-) time decrease to fifty dollars ($50). 
The scope of the emergency amendment is limited to the circum- stances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. In devel- oping this emergency amendment, the committee has determined that the fee decrease is necessary for the 2017 renewal period to prevent funds from exceeding the maximum fund balance, thereby resulting in a transfer from the fund to general revenue as set forth in section 324.481.6, RSMo. Pursuant to section 324.001.10, RSMo, a com- pelling governmental interest is deemed to exist for the purposes of section 536.025, RSMo, for licensure fees to be reduced by emer- gency rule, if the projected fund balance of any agency assigned to the Division of Professional Registration is reasonably expected to exceed an amount that would require transfer from that fund to gen- eral revenue. The committee believes this emergency amendment to be fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency amendment was filed January 3, 2017, becomes effective January 13, 2017, and expires July 11, 2017.

MISSOURI Proposed Rules February 1, 2017 REGISTER Vol. 42, No. 3 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

(EE) Maximum achievable potential means energy savings and demand savings relative to a utility’s baseline energy forecast and baseline demand forecast, respectively, resulting from expected pro- gram participation and ideal implementation conditions. Maximum achievable potential establishes a maximum target for demand-side 
savings that a utility can expect to achieve through its demand-side programs and involves incentives that represent a very high portion of total programs costs and very short customer payback periods. Maximum achievable potential is considered the hypothetical upper- boundary of achievable demand-side savings potential, because it presumes conditions that are ideal and not typically observed; 
(FF) Measure means any device, technology, behavioral response mechanism, or operating procedure that makes it possible to deliver an adequate level and quality of energy service while— 
1. Using less energy than would otherwise be required; or 
2. Altering the time pattern of electricity so as to require less generating capacity or to allow the electric power to be supplied by more fuel-efficient units;

4. Non Energy Benefits may be included in cost-effectiveness tests unless they cannot be calculated with a reasonable degree of confidence; 
(JJ) Non-participant test (sometimes referred to as the ratepayer impact test or RIM test) is a measure of the difference between the change in total revenues paid to a utility and the change in total cost incurred by the utility as a result of the implementation of demand- side programs. The benefits are the avoided cost as a result of imple- mentation. The costs consist of incentives paid to participants, other costs incurred by the utility, and the loss in revenue as a result of diminished consumption. Utility costs include the costs to adminis- ter, deliver, and evaluate each demand-side program; 
(KK) Participant test means a test of the cost-effectiveness of demand-side programs that measures the economics of a demand- side program from the perspective of the customers participating in the program;

mentation; (OO) Realistic achievable potential means energy savings and 
demand savings relative to a utility’s baseline energy forecast and baseline demand forecast, respectively, resulting from expected pro- gram participation and realistic implementation conditions. Realistic achievable potential establishes a realistic target for demand-side sav- ings that a utility can expect to achieve through its demand-side pro- grams and involves incentives that represent a moderate portion of total program costs and longer customer payback periods when com- pared to those associated with maximum achievable potential; 
(PP) Societal cost test means the total resource cost test with the addition of societal benefits (externalities such as, but not limited to, environmental or economic benefits) to the total benefits of the total resource cost test;

(XX) Total resource cost test or TRC means a test that compares the sum of avoided costs to the sum of all incremental costs of end use measures that are implemented due to the program, as defined by the commission in rules. Benefits include the avoided costs, avoided probable environmental compliance costs, other avoided resource benefits (e.g., oil, natural gas, water), and other benefits that accrue to Missourians, including non-energy benefits as defined by the commission. Costs include the sum of all incremental costs of enduse measures that are implemented due to the program (including both utility and participant contributions), plus utility costs to admin- ister, deliver, and evaluate each demandside program. In estimating its avoided probable environmental compliance costs and non-energy benefits, the utility shall consider factors including, but not limited to: reductions in emissions liability under the Clean Air Act; reduc- tion in transmission and distribution costs; reductions in the utility’s load factor or peak load; reductions in fuel costs, health and safety improvements, etc; and

and the incentives or disincentives provided to the utility as a result of the inclusion or exclusion of [cost recovery component, utility lost revenue component, and/or utility incentive component in the] DSIM components as defined in 4 CSR 240-20.092(N). In this context the word “disincentives” means any barrier to the imple- mentation of a DSIM. There is no penalty authorized in this section. 
[(F)](G) Any cost recovery component of a DSIM shall be based on costs of demand-side programs approved by the commission in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand-Side Programs. Indirect costs associated with demand-side programs, including but not limited to, costs of utility market potential study, evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V), and/or utility’s portion of statewide technical [resource] reference manual, shall be allocat- ed to demand-side programs and thus shall be eligible for recovery through an approved DSIM. The commission shall approve any cost recovery component of a DSIM simultaneously with the programs approved in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand-Side Programs. 
[(G) Any utility lost revenue component of DSIM shall be based on energy or demand savings from utility demand-side programs approved by the commission in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand-Side Programs and measured and verified through EM&V. 
1. A utility cannot recover revenues lost due to utility demand-side programs unless it does not recover the fixed cost as set in the last general rate case, i.e., actual annual billed system kWh is less than the system kWh used to cal- culate rates to recover revenues as ordered by the commis- sion in the utility’s last general rate case. 
2. The commission shall order any utility lost revenue component of a DSIM simultaneously with the programs approved in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand- Side Programs. 
3. In a utility’s filing for demand-side program approval in which a utility lost revenue component of a DSIM is con- sidered, there is no requirement for any implicit or explicit utility lost revenue component of a DSIM or for a particular form of a lost revenue component of a DSIM. 
4. The commission may address lost revenues solely or in part, directly or indirectly, with a performance incentive mechanism through a utility incentive component of DSIM. 
5. Any explicit utility lost revenue component of a DSIM shall be implemented on a retrospective basis and all energy and demand savings to determine a DSIM utility lost revenue requirement must be measured and verified through EM&V prior to recovery.] 
(H) Any throughput disincentive component of DSIM shall be based on energy or demand savings from utility demand-side programs approved by the commission in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand-Side Programs and will be determined as a result of energy savings determined through EM&V. 
1. The commission shall order any throughput disincentive component of a DSIM simultaneously with the demand-side pro- grams approved in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand- Side Portfolio. 
2. In a utility’s filing in which a throughput disincentive component of a DSIM is considered, there is no requirement for any implicit or explicit utility throughput disincentive component of a DSIM or for a particular form of a throughput disincentive component of a DSIM. 
3. Any explicit throughput disincentive component of a DSIM shall be implemented on a prospective basis. 
[(H)](I) Any [utility incentive] earnings opportunity component of a DSIM shall be based on the performance of demand-side pro- grams approved by the commission in accordance with 4 CSR 240- 20.094 Demand-Side Programs and shall include a methodology for determining the utility’s [portion of annual net shared benefits achieved and documented through EM&V reports for 
approved demand-side programs. Each utility incentive com- ponent of a DSIM shall define the relationship between the utility’s portion of annual net shared benefits achieved and documented through EM&V reports, annual energy savings achieved and documented through EM&V reports as a per- centage of annual energy savings targets, and demand sav- ings achieved and documented through EM&V reports as a percentage of annual demand savings targets.] earnings opportunity amount for individual demand-side programs based upon program performance relative to commission-approved performance metrics for each demand-side program. 
1. [Annual] Energy and demand savings targets approved by the commission for use in the [utility incentive] earnings opportunity component of a DSIM are not necessarily the same as the incremen- tal [annual] energy and demand savings goals and cumulative [annual] energy and demand savings goals specified in [4 CSR 240-20.094] section (2). 
2. The commission shall order any [utility incentive] earnings opportunity component of a DSIM simultaneously with the demand-side programs approved in accordance with 4 CSR 240- 20.094 Demand-Side Programs. 
3. Any [utility incentive] earnings opportunity component of a DSIM shall be implemented on a retrospective basis and all energy and demand savings used to determine a DSIM [utility incentive revenue requirement] earnings opportunity amount must be measured and verified through EM&V. 
[(I)](J) If the DSIM proposed by the utility includes adjustments to DSIM rates between general rate proceedings, the DSIM shall include a provision to adjust the DSIM rates [every six (6) months] not less than annually to include a true-up for over- and under-[collection]recovery of the DSIM [revenue requirement] amount as well as the impact on the DSIM cost recovery [revenue requirement] amount as a result of approved new, modified, or deleted demand-side programs. 
[(J)](K) If the commission approves [utility incentive] an earn- ings opportunity component of a DSIM, such [utility incentive] earnings opportunity component shall be binding on the commis- sion for the entire term of the DSIM, and such DSIM shall be bind- ing on the electric utility for the entire term of the DSIM, unless oth- erwise ordered or conditioned by the commission when approved. 
[(K)](L) The commission shall apportion the DSIM [revenue requirement] amount to each customer class. 
(3) Application for Discontinuation of a DSIM. The commission shall allow or require a DSIM to be discontinued or any component of a DSIM to be discontinued only after providing the opportunity for a hearing. 
(A) When submitting an application to discontinue a DSIM, [T]the electric utility shall [meet the filing requirements in 4 CSR 240-3.163(4).] file with the commission and serve on par- ties as provided in section (14), the following supporting informa- tion as part of, or in addition to, direct testimony. Supporting workpapers shall be submitted with all models and spreadsheets provided as executable versions in native format with all formulas intact: 
1. An example of the notice to be provided to customers; 
2. If the utility’s DSIM allows adjustments of the DSIM rates between general rate proceedings, a complete explanation of how the over-/under-recovery of the DSIM amount that the elec- tric utility is proposing to discontinue shall be handled; 
3. A complete explanation of why the DSIM is no longer nec- essary to provide the electric utility a sufficient opportunity to recover demand-side programs costs, throughput disincentive, and/or to receive an earnings opportunity; 
4. A complete explanation of any change in business risk to the electric utility resulting from discontinuation of an earnings opportunity related to the DSIM in setting the electric utility’s

allowed return on equity, in addition to any other changes in business risk experienced by the electric utility; and 
5. Any additional information the commission orders to be provided. 
(4) Requirements for [Semi-Annual] Adjustments of DSIM Rates[, if the Commission Approves Adjustments of DSIM Rates] Between General Rate Proceedings. [Semi-Annual a]Adjustments to DSIM rates between general rate proceedings shall [only] occur not less than annually, and may include adjustments to the DSIM cost recovery [revenue requirement and shall not include any adjustment to the DSIM utility lost revenue requirement] amount, the DSIM throughput disincentive amount, and/or the DSIM [utility incentive revenue requirement] earnings oppor- tunity amount. [Adjustments to the DSIM cost recovery rev- enue requirement may reflect new and approved demand- side programs, approved program modifications, and/or approved program discontinuations.] 
(A) The electric utility shall file tariff sheets to adjust its DSIM rates accompanied by supporting testimony and contain at least the following supporting information. All models and spread- sheets shall be provided as executable versions in native format with all formulas intact. 
1. Amount of revenue that it has over-/under-recovered through the most recent recovery period by rate class. 2. Proposed adjustments or refunds by rate class. 
3. Electric utility’s short-term borrowing rate. 4. Proposed adjustments to the current DSIM rates. 5. Complete documentation for the proposed adjustments to 
the current DSIM rates. 6. Any additional information the commission ordered to be 
provided. (B) [When an electric utility files tariff sheets to adjust its 
DSIM rates between general rate proceedings, t]The staff shall examine and analyze the information filed by the electric utility [in accordance with 4 CSR 240-3.163(8)] and additional informa- tion obtained through discovery, if any, to determine if the proposed adjustments to the DSIM [cost recovery revenue requirement] amount and DSIM rates are in accordance with the provisions of this rule, section 393.1075, RSMo, and the DSIM established, modified, or continued in the most recent filing for demand-side program approval. The staff shall submit a recommendation regarding its examination and analysis to the commission not later than thirty (30) days after the electric utility files its tariff sheets to adjust its DSIM rates. If the adjustments to the [DSIM cost recovery revenue requirement and] DSIM rates are in accordance with the provisions of this rule, section 393.1075, RSMo, and the DSIM established, modified, or continued in the most recent filing for demand-side pro- gram approval, the commission shall issue an interim rate adjustment order approving the tariff sheets and the adjustments to the DSIM rates shall take effect sixty (60) days after the tariff sheets were filed. If the adjustments to the [DSIM cost recovery revenue require- ment and] DSIM rates are not in accordance with the provisions of this rule, section 393.1075, RSMo, or the DSIM established, modi- fied, or continued in the most recent filing for demand-side program approval, the commission shall reject the proposed tariff sheets with- in sixty (60) days of the electric utility’s filing and may instead order the filing of interim tariff sheets that implement its decision and approval. 
[(A)](C) An electric utility with a DSIM shall file to adjust its DSIM rates [once every six (6) months] no less often than annu- ally. 
[(B)](D) [The semi-annual a]Adjustments to the DSIM rates shall reflect a comprehensive measurement of both increases and decreases to the DSIM [cost recovery revenue requirement] amount established in the most recent demand-side program approval or [semi-annual] DSIM rate adjustment case plus the change in DSIM [cost recovery revenue requirement] amount which occurred since the most recent demand-side program approval 
or [semi-annual] DSIM rate adjustment case. All DSIM rate adjust- ments shall include a true-up of past DSIM collections based on the latest EM&V results where applicable. Any over-/under-recovered amounts will be accounted for in the going forward DSIM rates. 
[(C)](E) The electric utility shall be current on its submission of its Surveillance Monitoring Reports as required in section (9) and its annual reports as required in section (8) in order to increase the DSIM rates. 
[(D)](F) If the staff, public counsel, or other party receives infor- mation which has not been submitted in compliance with [4 CSR 240-3.163(8)] subsection (4)(A), it shall notify the electric utility within ten (10) days of the electric utility’s filing of an application or tariff sheets to adjust DSIM rates and identify the information required. The electric utility shall submit the information identified by the party, or shall notify the party that it believes the information submitted was in compliance with the requirements of [4 CSR 240- 3.163(8)] subsection (4)(A), within ten (10) days of the request. A party who notifies the electric utility it believes the electric utility has not submitted all the information required by [4 CSR 240- 3.163(8)] subsection (4)(A) and as ordered by the commission in a previous proceeding and receives notice from the electric utility that the electric utility believes it has submitted all required informa- tion may file a motion with the commission for an order directing the electric utility to produce that information, i.e., a motion to compel. While the commission is considering the motion to compel, the pro- cessing timeline for the adjustment to increase DSIM rates shall be suspended. If the commission then issues an order requiring the information be submitted, the time necessary for the information to be submitted shall further extend the processing timeline for the adjustment to increase DSIM rates. For good cause shown, the com- mission may further suspend this timeline. Any delay in submitting sufficient information in compliance with [4 CSR 240-3.163(8)] subsection (4)(A) or a commission order in a previous proceeding in a request to decrease DSIM rates shall not alter the processing time- line. 
(5) Implementation of DSIM. Once a DSIM is approved, modified, or discontinued by the commission, the utility may request deferral accounting using the utility’s latest approved weighted average cost of capital until the utility’s next general rate proceeding. At the time of filing the general rate proceeding subsequent to DSIM approval, modification, or discontinuance, the commission shall use an interim rate adjustment order to implement the approved, modified, or dis- continued DSIM. 
(A) Duration of DSIM. Once a DSIM is approved by the commis- sion, it shall remain in effect [for a term of not more than four (4) years unless the commission earlier authorizes] to allow full recovery of all DSIM amounts or for the term otherwise ordered by the commission. The commission may authorize the modification or discontinuance of the DSIM [although an], or change the duration previously approved. The electric utility shall submit proposed tariff sheets to implement interim [semi-annual] adjustments to its DSIM rates between general rate proceedings. During the term of an approved DSIM, any party to the applica- tion for a utility’s filing for demand-side program approval may propose modifications to the DSIM. The utility may apply to modify the DSIM per section (2). 
[(B) If the utility has an implemented DSIM, the electric utility shall file a general rate proceeding within four (4) years after the effective date of the commission order imple- menting the DSIM, assuming the maximum statutory sus- pension of the rates so filed.] 
(6) Disclosure [on Customer’s Bills]. Regardless of whether or not the utility requests adjustments of its DSIM rates between general rate proceedings, any amounts charged under a DSIM approved by the commission, including any [utility incentives] earnings oppor- tunity allowed by the commission, shall be separately disclosed on each customer’s bill. Proposed language regarding this disclosure

2. Shall file an application with the commission for modifi- cation of demand-side programs including, but not limited to, the following: 
A. Reallocation of funds among demand-side programs; 
B. Changes in allocation based on contract implementers input, such as if a demand-side program is performing below expectations; 
C. Changes in incentive amounts paid to customers; 3. The application shall include a complete explanation for and documentation of the proposed modifications to each of the filing requirements in section (3). All models and spreadsheets shall be provided as executable versions in native format with all 
formulas intact; 4. The electric utility shall serve a copy of its application to 
all parties to the case under which the demand-side programs were approved; 
5. The parties shall have thirty (30) days from the date of fil- ing of an application to object to the application to modify;

If no objection is raised within thirty (30) days, [T]the commission shall approve, approve with modification acceptable to the electric utility, or reject such applications for approval of modifi- cation of demand-side programs within [thirty (30)] forty-five (45) days of the filing of an application under this section, subject to the same guidelines as established in [sub]section[s] (3)[(A) through (C), only after providing the opportunity for a hearing.]; 
7. If objections to the application are raised, the commission shall provide the opportunity for a hearing. 
[(A)](B) For any demand-side program design modifications approved by the commission, the utility shall file for and receive approval of associated tariff sheets prior to implementation of approved modifications. 
[(5)](6) Applications for Approval to Discontinue Electric Utility Demand-Side Programs. Pursuant to the provisions of this rule, 4 CSR 240-2.060, and section 393.1075, RSMo, an electric utility may file an application with the commission to discontinue demand- side programs [by filing information and documentation required by 4 CSR 240-3.164(5)]. 
(A) The application shall include the following information. All models and spreadsheets shall be provided as executable versions in native format with all formulas intact. 
1. Complete explanation for the utility’s decision to request to discontinue a demand-side program. 
2. EM&V reports for the demand-side program in question. 
3. Date by which a final EM&V report for the demand-side program in question will be filed. 
(B) If a demand-side program subject to the TRC is deter- mined not to be cost-effective, the electric utility shall identify the causes why and present possible demand-side program modifica- tions that could make the demand-side program cost-effective. If analysis of these modified demand-side program designs suggests that none would be cost-effective, the demand-side program may be discontinued.

Title 6—DEPARTMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION Division 10—Commissioner of Higher Education Chapter 3—[Higher Educational] Residency [Determination] and Transfer 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
6 CSR 10-3.010 Determination of Student Residency. The depart- ment is deleting sections (4), (5), and (8); deleting subsections (7)(B), (7)(C), (9)(F), (9)(G), and (9)(H); adding subsections (2)(B), (2)(C), (2)(D), (3)(B), (3)(C), and (3)(D); and amending the chapter title and subsections (1)(B), (1)(E), (1)(F)–(1)(J), (2)(A), (3)(A), (6)(B), (6)(C), (6)(D), (7)(A), (9)(A), (9)(C), (9)(D), (9)(E), (9)(H), (10)(A), (10)(B), (11)(B), and (11)(C), and renumbering as neces- sary. 
PURPOSE: This amendment eliminates repetition, rephrases with simpler and fewer words, updates word choice, and more logically organizes the criteria and requirements for student residency deter- minations by institutions and the department. Furthermore, this amendment implements the military tuition benefits provided by SB 968 (2016) and harmonizes state tuition benefits for veterans with more generous federal requirements. 
(1) Definitions. (B) Adult student shall mean any emancipated minor student or 
any student having attained the age of twenty-one (21) years. (E) Dependent student shall mean, for the purposes of state finan- 
cial aid eligibility, any student who is not an independent student. (F) Domicile shall mean presence [within] in a state with an intent of making the state a permanent home for an indefinite period. (G) Emancipated minor student shall mean any student not having attained the age of twenty-one (21) years and who is not under the care, custody, and support of a[n individual or individuals having] legal [custody] custodian(s). An unemancipated minor may become emancipated through marriage, formal court action, abandonment, or positive action of alienation on the part of the minor. Mere absence of the minor student from the domicile of his or her legal custodian(s) shall not constitute proof of emanci- pation. Any minor student taken as an income tax deduction by anyone other than a spouse shall be considered an unemancipat- ed minor. In all instances, alienation from care, custody, and sup- port shall be complete, and the burden of satisfactory proof of 
emancipation shall be that of the minor student.

(H) Independent student shall mean, for the purposes of state financial aid eligibility, any student who qualifies as an independent student under section 480(d) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, codified at 20 U.S.C. section 1087vv(d). 
(I) Residency or resident status shall mean that status which is achieved when sufficient proof of [a] domicile [within] in a state is presented. 
(J) Unemancipated minor student shall mean any student not hav- ing attained the age of twenty-one (21) years, and who remains under the care, custody, or support of the [individual or individuals having] legal [custody] custodian(s) of the student[s].

domicile. 
(B) Domicile of an unemancipated minor student is presumed to be that of the student’s legal custodian(s). In order to estab- lish domicile for an unemancipated minor student, a divorced or separated legal custodian claiming Missouri residency must, in addition to the factors listed in section (6) of this rule, show— 
1. A divorce decree or separation agreement giving the resi- dent legal custodian joint or sole legal or physical custody of the unemancipated minor student; or 
2. A notarized declaration that the unemancipated minor student resides with the resident legal custodian a majority of the year. 
(C) Once an unemancipated minor establishes residency under this rule, they may continue to qualify for resident status so long as they remain continuously enrolled, excluding summer terms, in a Missouri institution of higher education, even if the legal cus- todian(s) of the unemancipated minor student cease to hold Missouri resident status or the student becomes an adult student. 
(D) The criteria set forth in this rule for establishing Missouri residency shall also apply to determinations of in-district residen- cy for public community college districts. 
(3) State Financial Aid Eligibility. (A) [Independent Student. For purposes of financial aid eli- 
gibility, i]If a[n] nonresident independent student[, not a resident, shall] or dependent student’s nonresident legal custodian(s) pre- sents sufficient proof of [the establishment of a] domicile [within the state of] in Missouri, [this] such student shall be granted res- ident status at the first enrollment following the establishment of the domicile. 
(B) Domicile of a dependent student is presumed to be that of the student’s legal custodian(s). In order to establish domicile for a dependent student, a divorced or separated legal custodian claiming Missouri residency must, in addition to the factors listed in section (6) of this rule, show that his or her information was reported on the student’s Free Application for Federal Student Aid. 
(C) Once a dependent student establishes resident status under this rule, they may continue to qualify for resident status so long as they remain continuously enrolled, excluding summer terms, in a Missouri institution of higher education, even if the legal cus- todian(s) of the dependent student ceases to hold Missouri resi- dent status or the student becomes an independent student. 
(D) Resident status is one (1) criterion of eligibility for state financial aid awards administered by the coordinating board. Resident status does not guarantee an award of state financial aid. 
[(4) Unemancipated Minor Students. 
(A) The domicile of an unemancipated minor or a depen- dent student is presumed to be that of the individual or indi- viduals having legal custody of the student. 
(B) If those having legal custody of the unemancipated minor or dependent student establish a Missouri domicile, that student shall be granted resident status at the first enrollment following the establishment of the Missouri domi- cile. 
(C) Once unemancipated minor or dependent students have established resident status under this rule, they may continue to qualify for resident status so long as they remain continuously enrolled, excluding summer terms, in a Missouri institution of higher education, even if the individ- ual or individuals having legal custody of the unemancipated minor or dependent students cease to hold Missouri resident status or the students become adult or independent stu- dents. 
(5) Emancipated Minor Students. (A) The domicile of emancipated minor students shall be 
determined as if they were adults. (B) A minor may become emancipated through marriage, 
formal court action, abandonment, or positive action of alienation on the part of the minor. In all instances, alienation from care, custody, and support shall be complete and the burden of satisfactory proof of emancipation shall be that of the minor student. 
(C) Mere absence of the student from the domicile of the individual or individuals having legal custody of that minor student shall not constitute proof of emancipation. 
(D) In no instance shall a minor student be eligible for emancipation when that student is taken as an income tax deduction by a second party other than a spouse.] 
[(6)](4) Members of the Military Forces. (A) Students shall neither gain nor lose resident status solely as a 
consequence of military service. (B) [For the purposes of student resident status, m]Military 
personnel, when stationed [within the state of] in Missouri pur- suant to military orders, their spouses, and [unemancipated minor or dependent children] dependents, as defined at 37 U.S.C. sec- tion 401(a) for tuition purposes and at subsection (1)(E) of this rule for state aid purposes, shall be regarded as holding Missouri resident status. However, a member of the military forces who is specifically assigned, under orders, to attend a Missouri institution of higher education as a full-time student, shall be classified, along with his/her spouse and [unemancipated minor or dependent children] dependents, as if they had no connection with the military forces. 
(C) Any individual who is currently serving in the Missouri National Guard or a reserve component of the military forces of the United States or who is in the process of separating from any branch of the military forces of the United States with an honorable or a general discharge shall have resident status for purposes of admission and—

A. Demonstrates presence [within the state] in Missouri; and 
B. Declares residency [within the state] in Missouri; or 2. In-state, in-district tuition at any public community college, 
if the individual— A. Demonstrates presence [within] in the taxing district; and B. Declares residency [within] in the taxing district.

Page 176 
Proposed Rules 
February 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 3 
receipt of formal separation orders but prior to [one (1)] three (3) years after receiving an honorable or general discharge; 
2. An individual may demonstrate presence and declare residen- cy [within the state] in Missouri and/or the taxing district through a signed statement indicating the individual currently resides [within the state] in Missouri and/or the taxing district and intends to make [the state of] Missouri and/or the taxing district a permanent home; and 
3. Discharge status shall be determined based on information contained in the Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD 214). 
[(7)](5) Noncitizens of the United States. (A) [Students] Individuals who are not citizens of the United 
States must possess [resident alien] a lawful immigration status, as determined by the federal [authority] government, prior to con- sideration for resident status as otherwise provided in this rule, except that individuals and their family members who hold F, J, or M visa status are ineligible for resident status. 
[(B) Aliens present within Missouri as representatives of a foreign government or at the convenience of the United States or Missouri governments and holding G visas shall be entitled to resident status, except for those who are govern- ment-funded students. 
(C) Aliens and their dependents holding A or L visas may be granted resident status if determined to be individually designated as representatives of their governments and whose education is not government-funded. 
(8) Public Community College Residency. (A) Missouri public community college districts have legal 
geographic boundaries within the state and only residents of each district are eligible for the in-district student fee charge. (B) For purposes of establishing district residency, a Missouri resident who resides out-of-district shall meet the same criteria as set forth in this rule for establishing Missouri residency by a person not a resident of Missouri. However, Missouri residency is the only residency requirement ger- mane to student eligibility for financial aid programs restrict- 
ed to Missouri residents.] 
[(9)](6) Determination of Resident Status. (A) Attendance at an institution of higher education shall be 
regarded as a temporary presence [within the state] inside or out- side of Missouri; therefore, a student neither gains nor loses resident status solely by such attendance. 
(B) The burden of proof of establishing eligibility for Missouri res- ident status shall rest with the student. 
(C) [In determining resident status for the state of Missouri, e]Either of the following shall be sufficient proof of domicile [of a person and his/her unemancipated minor or dependent children within the state of] in Missouri: 
1. Presence [within the state of] in Missouri for a minimum of the twelve (12) immediate past, consecutive months coupled with proof of intent, pursuant to subsection (D) of this section, to make [the state of] Missouri a permanent home for an indefinite period; or 
2. Presence [within the state of] in Missouri for the purpose of retirement, full-time employment, full-time professional practice, or to conduct a business full-time coupled with proof of intent, pur- suant to subsection (D) of this section, to make [the state of] Missouri a permanent home for an indefinite period. 
(D) In determining whether an adult[, emancipated minor,] or independent student, or the [individual or individuals having] legal [custody] custodian(s) of an unemancipated minor or depen- dent student[, holds an intent] intends to make [the state of] Missouri a permanent home for an indefinite period, the following factors, although not conclusive, shall be [given heavy weight] 
considered: 1. Heavily weighted factors— 
A. [c]Continuous presence in [the state of] Missouri dur- ing those periods not enrolled as a student; 
B. [presence within the state of Missouri upon m]Marriage to a Missouri resident and [the maintenance of a common domicile] sharing a home with the resident spouse in Missouri; 
C. [s]Substantial reliance on sources [within the state of] in Missouri for financial support; 
D. [f]Former domicile [within the state] in Missouri and maintenance of significant connections while absent; and 
E. [o]Ownership of a home [within the state of] in Missouri[.]; [The twelve (12)- month period of presence with- in the state, as stipulated in paragraph (9)(C)1. of this rule, in and of itself, does not establish resident status in the absence of the required proof of intent.] 
[(E)]2. [The following factors shall be given less weight than those in subsection (9)(D) and include] Lightly weighted factors[:]— 
A. [Voting or r]Registration for voting; B. [p]Part-time employment; C. [l]Lease of living quarters; D. [a]A written statement of intent[ion] to establish [a] 
domicile in Missouri; E. [a]Automobile registration or [operator’s] driver’s 
license obtained in Missouri; and F. [p]Payment of income, personal, [and] or property taxes 
in Missouri. [The factors listed in this subsection have applic- ability only as they support the intent to make the state of Missouri a permanent home for an indefinite period. 
(F) Resident status is one criterion of eligibility for student grant awards administered by the coordinating board. There are additional criteria of eligibility and the establishment of resident status by a student does not guarantee that the stu- dent will be awarded a student grant. 
(G) The waiver or forgiveness of a nonresident student fee, in full or in part, shall have no bearing on the residency status of a student and shall not be a basis for classification of a nonresident student as a resident. 
(H) For those nonresidents who pay Missouri income tax, the nonresident student shall receive a credit against the nonresident student fee in an amount equal to the actual Missouri income tax paid for the previous calendar year except that the remaining fee obligation shall not be less than the amount of the resident student fee. Unemancipated minor students are eligible by reason of payment of Missouri income tax by the nonresident individual or individuals hav- ing legal custody of students. Students entering in January shall be regarded as entering in the immediately preceding fall for purposes of determining previous calendar year. For students entering after January, previous year means imme- diate past calendar year.] 
[(10)](7) [Determination of] Grace Period for Loss of Residency Status. 
(A) An adult[,] or emancipated minor[, or independent] student will lose Missouri residency status twelve (12) consecutive months after [establishing a domicile outside of the state of Missouri, unless the absence is for the purpose of attending an insti- tution of higher education in another state and the student remains in compliance with subsections (9)(C)–(E) of this administrative rule] he or she can no longer demonstrate suffi- cient proof of domicile, as provided in this rule. 
(B) An unemancipated minor or dependent student will lose Missouri residency status[: 
1. T]twelve (12) consecutive months after the [individual or individuals having] legal [custody] custodian(s) of that student

[2. If the individual or individuals having legal custody of that student establish a domicile outside of the state of Missouri more than twelve (12) consecutive months before the student’s first enrollment at a postsecondary education institution.] 
[(11)](8) Administrative and Compliance. (A) Each institution shall establish procedures for the determina- 
tion of institutional decisions in accordance with this rule. These pro- cedures shall adhere to the guidelines set forth in this rule and to the concepts of procedural fairness and reasonableness to the students, to the institution and to the taxpaying public of the state. The proce- dures shall provide for at least two (2) levels of institutional appeal review and the last stage of the procedure shall be considered final by the institution. 
(B) Compliance with the guidelines as set forth in this rule is required of institutions of higher education in order to be determined as eligible institutions under [student] state financial aid programs administered by the coordinating board and for which student eligi- bility is restricted to residents. For state financial aid purposes, insti- tutions may exercise professional judgment in residency determina- tions for documented exceptional circumstances. 
(C) On complaint of any student or other indication of possible institutional noncompliance with the guidelines set forth in this rule, the coordinating board may review the eligibility of an institution for [student] state financial aid programs, or any other funds adminis- tered by the board and may take such actions or make such recom- mendations relating to the institution’s eligibility as the coordinating board deems appropriate. These actions shall be consistent with any other administrative rules the board has established pertaining to the review of institutional eligibility.

Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 70—MO HealthNet Division Chapter 15—Hospital Program 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 13 CSR 70-15.220 Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments. 
The division is amending section (8). 
PURPOSE: This amendment clarifies and amends the state DSH sur- vey reporting requirements and exceptions process to receive an interim DSH payment or an adjustment to the interim DSH payment. 
(8) State DSH Survey Reporting Requirements. (B) Beginning in SFY 2016, each hospital must complete and sub- 
mit the state DSH survey set forth in paragraph (2)(W)4. (i.e., required state DSH survey) to the independent DSH auditor, the MO HealthNet Division’s authorized agent, in order to be considered for an interim DSH payment for the subsequent SFY (i.e., DSH surveys collected during SFY 2016 will be used to calculate SFY 2017 inter- im DSH payments). The independent DSH auditor will distribute the state DSH survey template to the hospitals to complete and will noti- fy them of the due date, which shall be a minimum of thirty (30) days from the date it is distributed. However, the state DSH survey is due to the independent DSH auditor no later than March 1 preceding the beginning of each state fiscal year for which the interim DSH pay- ment is being calculated (i.e., the state DSH survey used for SFY 2017 interim DSH payments will be due to the independent DSH auditor no later than March 1, 2016). Hospitals that do not submit the state DSH survey by March 1 will not be eligible to receive an interim DSH payment for that SFY. The division may grant an indus- try-wide extension on the March 1 deadline due to unanticipated cir- cumstances that affect the industry as a whole. The independent DSH auditor may perform an initial review of the required state DSH survey submitted by the hospital and make preliminary adjustments for use in calculating the interim DSH payment. The independent DSH auditor shall provide the hospital with any preliminary adjustments that are made for review and comment prior to the data being provided to MHD for use in calculating the interim DSH payment for the SFY. Additional or revised audit adjustments may be made to the DSH survey for purposes of the independent DSH audit. 
1. A new facility that does not have cost report data for the fourth prior year may complete the state DSH survey using actual, untrended cost and payment data from the most recent twelve- (12-) month cost report filed with the division. 
2. A new facility that has not yet filed a twelve- (12-) month Medicaid cost report with the division may complete the state DSH survey using facility projections to reflect anticipated operations for 
the interim DSH payment period. Trends shall not be applied to the data used to complete the state DSH survey. Interim DSH payments determined from this state DSH survey are limited to the industry average estimated interim DSH payment as set forth in subsection (4)(F). 
3. Hospitals may elect not to receive an interim DSH payment for a SFY by completing a DSH Waiver form. Hospitals that elect not to receive an interim DSH payment for a SFY must notify the division, or its authorized agent, that it elects not to receive an inter- im DSH payment for the upcoming SFY. If a hospital does not receive an interim DSH payment for a SFY, it will not be included in the independent DSH audit related to that SFY, and will not be eli- gible for final DSH audit payment adjustments related to that SFY unless it submits a request to the division to be included in the inde- pendent DSH audit. 
4. If a hospital received an interim DSH payment and later determined that it did not have uncompensated care costs for Medicaid and the uninsured to support part or all the interim DSH payment that it received or is receiving, the hospital may request that the interim DSH payments be stopped or it may return the entire interim DSH payment it received. 
5. Exceptions Process to Use Alternate [State DSH Survey] Data for Interim DSH Payment. 
A. A hospital may submit a request to the division to have its interim DSH payment based on [a state DSH survey completed using the actual, untrended cost and payment data from the most recent twelve- (12-) month cost report filed with the division (i.e., alternate state DSH survey)] alternate data as set forth below rather than the state DSH survey required to be submit- ted for the year (i.e., required state DSH survey) if it meets the cri- teria for any of the circumstances detailed below in subparagraph (8)(B)5.D. The request must include an explanation of the circum- stance, the impact it has on the required state DSH survey period, and how it causes the data to be materially misstated or unrepresen- tative. The division shall review the facility’s request and may, at its discretion and for good cause shown, use the alternate [state DSH survey] data in determining the interim DSH payment for the SFY. The division shall notify the facility of its decision regarding the request. 
(I) Alternate state DSH survey. A state DSH survey completed using the actual, untrended cost and payment data from the most recent twelve- (12-) month cost report filed with the division. Any hospital requesting an exception must complete an alternate state DSH survey. If the most recent full year cost report filed with the division does not reflect the impact of any material changes, a supplemental schedule, as defined below, may be completed and submitted in addition to the alternate state DSH survey. If the impact of any changes is reflected in the most recent full year cost report filed with the division, the facil- ity may only use the alternate state DSH survey. 
(II) Alternate state DSH survey supplemental schedule. A supplemental schedule developed by the division to recognize material changes that have occurred at a hospital that are not yet reflected in the hospital’s alternate state DSH survey. The supple- mental schedule uses the data from the alternate state DSH sur- vey as the basis and includes additional fields to reflect changes that occurred subsequent to the alternate state DSH survey peri- od through the SFY for which the interim DSH payment is being calculated. The blank alternate state DSH survey supplemental schedule is referred to as the alternate state DSH survey supple- mental template. This template and instructions are incorporated by reference and made a part of this rule as published by the Department of Social Services, MO HealthNet Division, 615 Howerton Court, Jefferson City, MO 65109, at its website dss.mo.gov/mhd, February 1, 2017. This rule does not incorpo- rate any subsequent amendments or additions. 
B. The provider must submit both the required state DSH sur- vey and the alternate [state DSH survey to the independent

DSH auditor] data for review to determine if the facility meets the criteria set forth below in subparagraph (8)(B)5.D. 
C. The interim DSH payment based on the applicable alter- nate [state DSH survey] data shall be calculated in the same man- ner as the interim DSH payment based on the required state DSH survey, except [that the trends applied to the alternate state DSH survey shall be from the year subsequent to the alter- nate state DSH survey period to the current SFY for which the interim DSH payment is being determined] for the trends applied to the alternate data as noted below in part (8)(B)5.C.(I) and (II). The allocation percentage calculated at the beginning of the SFY year as set forth in part (4)(B)4.A.(I) shall be applied to the estimated UCC net of OOS DSH payments based on the alter- nate data to determine the preliminary interim DSH payment. 
(I) Alternate state DSH survey. The trends applied to the alternate state DSH survey shall be from the year subsequent to the alternate state DSH survey period to the current SFY for which the interim DSH payment is being determined. 
(II) Alternate state DSH survey supplemental schedule. Trends shall not be applied to an alternate state DSH survey sup- plemental schedule since it incorporates changes from the full year cost report period through the SFY for which the interim DSH payment is being calculated. 
D. Following are the circumstances for which a provider may request that its interim DSH payment be based on [the] alternate [state DSH survey] data rather than the required state DSH survey, including the criteria and other requirements: 
(I) Twenty Percent (20.00%) DSH Outlier. A provider may request that the alternate state DSH survey be used prior to the inter- im DSH payment being determined for the SFY if the Untrended Total Estimated Net Cost on the “Report Summary” tab, Column J, from the alternate state DSH survey is at least twenty percent (20.00%) higher than the Trended Total Estimated Net Cost on the “Report Summary” tab, Column L, from the required state DSH sur- vey (i.e., the increase is at least twenty percent (20.00%) rounded to two (2) decimal places). 
(a) Both the required state DSH survey and the alternate state DSH survey must be submitted to the independent DSH auditor and the division, respectively, no later than March 1 preceding the beginning of each SFY for which interim DSH payments are being made; 
(II) Extraordinary Circumstances. A provider may request that [the] alternate [state DSH survey] data be used if the facility experienced an extraordinary circumstance during or after the required state DSH survey report period up to the SFY for which the interim DSH payment is being calculated that caused the required DSH survey report period to be materially misstated and unrepresen- tative. If circumstances found in items (8)(B)5.D.(II)(a)I.–III. below are applicable, the facility may [supply trends in addition to the cumulative trend defined in subsection (2)(Y) to reflect antic- ipated operations for the SFY for which the interim DSH pay- ment is being calculated. The facility must also provide an explanation justifying the additional trends] complete and sub- mit the applicable alternate data. 
(a) Extraordinary circumstances include unavoidable cir- cumstances that are beyond the control of the facility and include the following: 
I. Act of nature (i.e., tornado, hurricane, flooding, earthquake, lightening, natural wildfire, etc.); 
II. War; III. Civil disturbance; or IV. If the data to complete the required state DSH sur- 
vey set forth in paragraph (2)(W)4. is not available due to a change in ownership because the prior owner is out of business and is unco- operative and unwilling to provide the necessary data. 
(b) A change in hospital operations or services (i.e., ter- minating or adding a service or a hospital wing; or, a change of owner, except as noted in item (8)(B)5.D.(II)(a)IV., manager, con- 
trol, operation, leaseholder or leasehold interest, or Medicare provider number by whatever form for any hospital previously certi- fied at any time for participation in the MO HealthNet program, etc.) does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance. 
(c) Both the required state DSH survey and the alternate [state DSH survey] data must be submitted to the independent DSH auditor and the division, respectively, no later than March 1 if the alternate [state DSH survey] data is to be used to determine the interim DSH payment at the beginning of the SFY. 
(d) A hospital may submit a request to use [the] alter- nate [state DSH survey] data due to extraordinary circumstances after March 1, but the alternate [state DSH survey] data and the resulting interim DSH payment will be subject to the same require- ments as the Interim DSH Payment Adjustments noted below in sub- parts (8)(B)5.D.(III)(b)–(d). The requests relating to extraordinary circumstances received after the March 1 deadline will be included with the Interim DSH Payment Adjustments requests in part (8)(B)5.D.(III) in distributing the unobligated DSH allotment and available state funds remaining for the SFY; or 
(III) Interim DSH Payment Adjustment. (a) After the interim DSH payment has been calculated 
for the current SFY based on the required state DSH survey, a provider may request that [the] alternate [state DSH survey] data be used if the Untrended Total Estimated Net Cost on the “Report Summary” tab, Column J, from the alternate [state DSH survey] data is at least [thirty-five percent (35.00%)] twenty percent (20.00%) higher than the Trended Total Estimated Net Cost on the “Report Summary” tab, Column L, from the required state DSH sur- vey (i.e., the increase is at least [thirty-five percent (35.00%)] twenty percent (20.00%) rounded to two (2) decimal places). 
(b) The division will process interim DSH payment adjustments once a year. After all requests are received, the division will determine whether revisions to the interim DSH payments are appropriate. Any revisions to the interim DSH payments are subject to the unobligated DSH allotment remaining for the SFY and avail- ability of state funds. 
(c) The request, including the alternate data, must be submitted to the division by December 31 of the current SFY for which interim DSH payments are being made. 
(d) To the extent that state funds are available, [T]the DSH allotment for the SFY that has not otherwise been obligated will be distributed proportionally to the hospitals determined to meet the above criteria, based on the [revised estimated hospital-spe- cific DSH limit, less OOS DSH payments, subject to the availability of state funds.] difference between the preliminary interim DSH payment based on the alternate data and the origi- nal interim DSH payment; 
(IV) If a provider met the criteria to use alternate data for an Interim DSH Payment Adjustment ((8)(B)5.D.(III)) in the prior SFY, it may continue to use alternate data for its interim DSH payment until the required state DSH survey reflects the impact of the change. The hospital must submit the request and the alternate data to the division for review and approval no later than March 1.

Title 3—DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION Division 10—Conservation Commission Chapter 6—Wildlife Code: Sport Fishing: Seasons, Methods, Limits 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Conservation Commission under sec- tions 40 and 45 of Art. IV, Mo. Const., the commission amends a rule as follows: 
3 CSR 10-6.505 Black Bass is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on October 3, 2016 (41 MoReg 1303). No changes have been made in the text of the proposed amendment, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Conservation Commission received comments from thirty-five (35) individuals on proposed changes to 3 CSR 10-6.505 Black Bass. 
COMMENTS: Kyle Marler, location unknown; Marvin Lee Douglas, Houston; Danny Marshall, Steelville; Richard Rogers, Boise, ID; Steve Harrison, Ballwin; Frank Jones, location unknown; Andrew Acord, St. Louis; Robert Kinker, Ellisville, and Dan Zimmerman, Olathe, KS, voiced general support for the proposed changes. 
RESPONSE: The commission thanks those individuals who voiced support for the regulation changes. 
COMMENTS: Daniel Kreher, Ellisville; Troy McAfee, Winona; William Wakefield, Affton; Steve Harrison, Ballwin; Jerry Prewett, Pulaski Co.; Chris Holman, KS; Matthew Wier, St. Louis; Tori McAfee, Winona; Max & Lola Barkley, Winona, and Margaret McAfee, Winona, voiced support for the proposed changes but offered their opinions regarding alternate daily and length limits in and out of established black bass special management areas. RESPONSE: The commission thanks those individuals who voiced support for the proposed changes and appreciates their opinions and suggestions for improvements to the Wildlife Code. No changes to the amendment have been made as a result of these comments. 
COMMENT: Michael Lachtrup, location unknown, indicated inde- cision regarding the proposed changes. Instead, he suggested that all special management areas be catch and release only and a limit of one (1) fish per day be implemented on all other waters of the state. RESPONSE: Smallmouth bass fishing is very popular in Missouri Ozark streams. Smallmouth bass anglers take an average of ten (10) fishing trips per year. On average, anglers caught seven (7) small- mouth bass and harvested two (2) smallmouth bass per trip. On aver- age, it takes smallmouth bass five (5) years to attain a length of twelve inches (12"); seven (7) years to attain a length of fifteen inches (15"); and nine (9) to ten (10) years to attain a length of eighteen inches (18") in Missouri Ozark streams. Due to existing rates of mor- tality, few smallmouth bass live to be more than seven (7) to eight (8) years old. In order for more restrictive harvest regulations to produce a significant change in the number or size of fish in the population, three (3) conditions need to be present: 1) Fish need to be growing relatively fast and living relatively long, 2) Natural mortality rates need to be low, and 3) Harvest mortality rates need to be high. Where these three (3) conditions are not present, particularly a high rate of harvest, more restrictive harvest regulations will have little to no effect on changing the number or size of fish in the population. An exploitation study conducted from 2011 through 2014 examined angler harvest rates on selected Ozark streams. The study concluded that under most conditions, the statewide length limit of twelve inch- es (12") is adequate to balance the desire of quality fishing and har- vest opportunities on most Ozark streams. 
Currently, smallmouth bass have a statewide minimum-length limit of twelve inches (12") with a six (6) fish daily limit, while special

Orders of Rulemaking 

management areas have a minimum-length limit of fifteen (15) or eighteen (18) inches with a daily limit of one (1) or two (2) fish. The department is proposing no change to the statewide regulation and proposing a fifteen inch (15") minimum and one (1) fish per day on the special management areas. 
The department is proposing changes to existing fishing regula- tions to provide the best long-term, sustainable quality smallmouth bass and rock bass populations in Ozark streams. Proposed changes will simplify regulations for anglers to improve voluntary compli- ance, expand and redefine special management areas that will pro- vide additional protection and unique angling opportunities for our diverse fishing public, and set realistic expectations for Missouri anglers for these fisheries. No changes to the amendment have been made as a result of these comments. 
COMMENT: Brian Atchley, Forsyth, voiced general opposition to the proposed changes. RESPONSE: The commission appreciates citizen input on proposed regulation changes. No changes to the amendment have been made as a result of this comment. 
COMMENTS: Craig Nelson, Ozark, and Mark Hatfield, Grain Valley, voiced opposition to the proposed changes and called for stricter regulations to protect smallmouth bass statewide. RESPONSE: Currently, smallmouth bass have a statewide minimum- length limit of twelve inches (12") with a six (6) fish daily limit, while special management areas have a minimum-length limit of fif- teen (15) or eighteen (18) inches with a daily limit of one (1) or two (2) fish. The department is proposing no change to the statewide reg- ulation and proposing a fifteen inch (15") minimum and one (1) fish per day on the special management areas.

No changes to the amendment have been made as a result of these comments. 
COMMENTS: Matt Joachim, Poplar Bluff, and Eric Batton, Poplar Bluff, voiced opposition to the proposed changes. They do not support any reduction in the length limit for smallmouth bass on the Jacks Fork River and shared their preference for a statewide twelve inch (12") smallmouth bass length limit with a daily limit of six (6) fish. RESPONSE: As for the proposed changes to the Jacks Fork small- mouth bass regulations, we have proposed the smallmouth bass min- imum length limit change from eighteen (18) to fifteen (15) inches, while maintaining the one (1) fish daily limit. 
Although present, the percentage of fish exceeding eighteen inches (18") has not significantly increased since the eighteen inch (18”) regulation was put in place nearly twenty (20) years ago, and it appears few fish live long enough to reach that length. As we’ve seen multiple times within the past few years, the river can be a difficult environment to survive, let alone thrive. However, we have proposed extensions of the special management areas on the Jacks Fork River that will offer additional protection of valuable sections of quality smallmouth bass habitat. No changes to the amendment have been made as a result of these comments. 
COMMENTS: Lester Nicholson, Birch Tree; Bill Terry, Jadwin; Laurel Terry, TN; William Terry, Jadwin, and Devin Simms, AL, voiced opposition to the proposed changes and shared their prefer- ence for a statewide twelve inch (12") smallmouth bass length limit with a daily limit of six (6) fish. 
RESPONSE: Currently, smallmouth bass have a statewide minimum- length limit of twelve inches (12") with a six (6) fish daily limit, 
while special management areas have a minimum-length limit of fif- teen (15) or eighteen (18) inches with a daily limit of one (1) or two (2) fish.

No changes to the amendment have been made as a result of these comments. 
COMMENT: Brian Jones, Bonne Terre, voiced opposition to the proposed changes and called for stricter regulations to protect small- mouth bass statewide. Mr. Jones does not support any reduction in the length limit for smallmouth bass on the Jacks Fork River and requested that the Current River also be designated as a Smallmouth Bass Special Management Area. 
RESPONSE: As for the proposed changes to the Jacks Fork River, the department has proposed the smallmouth bass minimum length limit change from eighteen (18) to fifteen (15) inches, while maintaining the one (1) fish daily limit. Although present, the percentage of fish exceeding eighteen inches (18") has not significantly increased since the regulations went into place nearly twenty (20) years ago and it appears few fish live long enough to reach that length. 
Using results from recent research projects as well as public input, the department has proposed extensions of the special management areas on the Jacks Fork River to offer additional protection of valu- able sections of quality smallmouth bass habitat. 
During the department’s public input process, angler opposition for implementing a regulation change for the Current River was iden- tified. Therefore, after assessing the biological and social implica- tions associated with the proposed regulation change that would cre- ate a Smallmouth Bass Special Management Area on the Current River, the decision was made to not include this area as part of the regulation package at this time. No changes to the amendment have been made as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT: Kenton Lohraff, Dixon, voiced opposition to the pro- posed changes, citing his desire to harvest smaller fish for consump- tion. Instead, Mr. Lohraff voiced his preference for a length limit twelve (12) to fifteen (15) inches and a daily limit of three (3) fish. RESPONSE: Currently, smallmouth bass have a statewide minimum- length limit of twelve inches (12") with a six (6) fish daily limit, while special management areas have a minimum-length limit of fif- teen (15) or eighteen (18) inches with a daily limit of one (1) or two (2) fish. We are proposing no change to the statewide regulation and proposing a fifteen inch (15") minimum and one (1) fish per day on the special management areas.

No changes to the amendment have been made as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT: Robert Williams, Van Buren, voiced opposition to the proposed changes and called for elimination of the Smallmouth Bass Special Management Area on the Jacks Fork River, indicating that this change will result in thirty-five percent (35%) of all waters with small- mouth populations being designated as trophy areas. Instead, Mr. Williams believes that a daily limit of three (3) fish is more reasonable.

RESPONSE: The State of Missouri has over one hundred ten thou- sand (110,000) miles of streamside. As proposed, the special man- agement area regulations would cover just over four hundred (400) miles of Missouri streams. No changes to the amendment have been made as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT: Corey Cottrell, Steelville, voice opposition to the pro- posed changes and shared his preference for a statewide daily limit of three (3) smallmouth bass. RESPONSE: Currently, smallmouth bass have a statewide minimum- length limit of twelve inches (12") with a six (6) fish daily limit, while special management areas have a minimum-length limit of fif- teen (15) or eighteen (18) inches with a daily limit of one (1) or two (2) fish.

Title 3—DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION Division 10—Conservation Commission Chapter 6—Wildlife Code: Sport Fishing: Seasons, Methods, Limits 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Conservation Commission under sec- tions 40 and 45 of Art. IV, Mo. Const., the commission amends a rule as follows: 
3 CSR 10-6.530 Goggle-eye (Ozark Bass, Rock Bass, and Shadow Bass) and Warmouth is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on October 3, 2016 (41 MoReg 1303–1304). No changes have been made in the text of the proposed amendment, so it is not reprinted here. This pro- posed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Conservation Commission received comments from fifteen (15) individuals on proposed changes to 3 CSR 10-6.530 Goggle-eye (Ozark Bass, Rock Bass, and Shadow Bass) and Warmouth. 
COMMENTS: Brian Jones, Bonne Terre; Danny Marshall, Steelville; Corey Cottrell, Steelville, and Matthew Wier, St. Louis, voiced support for the proposed changes. RESPONSE: The commission thanks those individuals who voiced support for the regulation change. No changes have been made to the amendment as a result of these comments. 
COMMENTS: Daniel Kreher, Ellisville; Craig Carter, Ava; William Wakefield, Affton; Chris Holman, KS; Ken Olive, Camdenton; Ira Dale Kipp, Van Buren; Frank (last name unknown), location unknown, and Jerry Prewett, Pulaski Co., voiced general support for the proposed changes but offered suggestions for additional or alter- nate daily and/or length limits. 
RESPONSE: The commission thanks those individuals who voiced support for the regulation change. No changes to the amendment have been made as a result of these comments. 
COMMENT: Eric Biller, Agency, indicated indecision regarding the proposed changes. Mr. Biller suggested that the department implement a program to provide barbless hooks to outfitters and area businesses to encourage catch and release fishing. He also encouraged additional focus on habitat improvements along Missouri streams and rivers. RESPONSE: The commission appreciates citizen comments on a variety of topics. No changes to the amendment have been made as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT: Tim Feeler, Edgar Springs, voiced general opposition to the proposed changes but offered suggestions for additional or alternate daily and/or length limits. RESPONSE: A recently completed angler survey (2011) indicates that anglers harvest rock bass of any size, in proportion to the sizes that are caught. Harvest mortality rates are estimated to make up a significant portion of total annual mortality. As estimated from the angler survey, the overall harvest rate for rock bass in Missouri Ozark streams is fifty percent (50%). More than forty percent (40%) of anglers surveyed felt rock bass fishing quality has declined over the last ten (10) years. The majority of anglers favored implementation of a statewide minimum length limit (fifty-two percent (52%) favored, seventeen percent (17%) opposed, twenty-six percent (26%) had no opinion). Minimum length limit regulations have already been imple- mented on Ozark streams where there is the highest potential to pro- duce a noticeable improvement in the rock bass fishery (the existing six (6) special management areas). Having statewide regulations with some special management areas is well accepted by most anglers. Modeling of rock bass sampling data predicts a noticeable increase in the number of larger rock bass. No changes to the amendment have been made as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT: Kenton Lohraff, Dixon, indicated support for the change in larger streams, however, he does not support the proposed changes in smaller streams. Mr. Lohraff contends that implementa- tion of a seven inch (7") length limit in smaller streams will not pro- duce larger fish and will result in decreased harvest.

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Conservation Commission received comments from four (4) individuals on proposed changes to 3 CSR 10-11.215 Fishing, Length Limits.

COMMENT: Margaret McAfee, Winona, voiced general support for the proposed changes with the exception of proposed changes to the length limit for smallmouth bass on the Jacks Fork River. RESPONSE: The process for adding or changing regulations to the Wildlife Code of Missouri begins with evaluating the resource-based needs for the change. Staff evaluates the resource using biological and available angler survey data. Department staff then met as a team to see if adjustments in regulations can produce desired biological changes. The department sought public input on the proposed regu- lation changes for both smallmouth bass and rock bass through eight (8) open houses held at various locations around the state in the fall of 2015. Department staff held an additional public meeting in Van Buren on April 8, 2016. Our goal through this process was to listen to anglers from across the state to help make meaningful regulation changes to improve and sustain fish populations into the future. Based on the biological information we have and solid public input, we believe the proposed regulation changes will simplify regulations for anglers to improve voluntary compliance, expand and redefine special management areas that will provide additional protection and unique angling opportunities for our diverse fishing public, and set realistic expectations for Missouri anglers for these fisheries. 
As for the proposed changes to the Jacks Fork River smallmouth bass regulations, we have proposed the smallmouth bass minimum length limit change from eighteen (18) to fifteen (15) inches, while maintaining the one (1) fish daily limit. Although present, the per- centage of fish exceeding eighteen inches (18") has not significantly increased since the eighteen inch (18") regulation was put in place nearly twenty (20) years ago, and it appears few fish live long enough to reach that length. As we’ve seen multiple times within the past few years, the river can be a difficult environment to survive, let alone thrive. However, the proposed extensions of the special management areas on the Jacks Fork River will offer additional protection of valu- able sections of quality smallmouth bass habitat. No changes to the amendment have been made as a result of these comments.

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: A public hearing on this proposed rule was held November 2, 2016, and the public comment period ended November 2, 2016. At the public hearing, two (2) comments were made. 
COMMENT #1: Grady Martin, with the Division of Administration in the Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration, and Kathryn East, Executive Director of the Missouri Self-Storage Owners Association, each spoke at the public hearing in support of the proposed rule with the addition of a form register for limited lines self-service storage insurance produc- ers to use in compliance with section 379.1640.2(1)(b), RSMo. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Paragraph (3)(A)1. of the rule will be changed to accommodate a new Exhibit 2, representing the desired form. 
COMMENT #2: Kathryn East, Executive Director of the Missouri Self-Storage Owners Association, spoke in favor of increasing the coverage limit for self-service storage insurance producers’ authority in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000). 
RESPONSE: The five thousand dollar ($5,000) limit is explicitly imposed by subsection (6) of the enabling statute, section 379.1640, and therefore the department lacks authority to change that value by rule.

Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2220—State Board of Pharmacy Chapter 2—General Rules 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Board of Pharmacy under sections 338.140, 338.240, 338.280, and 338.315, RSMo 2016, the Board of Pharmacy adopts a rule as follows: 
20 CSR 2220-2.095 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on October 3, 2016 (41 MoReg 1376–1379). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The board received two (2) com- ments in response to the proposed rule. 
COMMENT #1: A comment was received from the National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) suggesting the board amend the rule to include and allow collection of controlled sub- stances for destruction. NACDS further commented controlled sub- stance requirements should align with federal law. The Missouri Retail Association (MRA) concurred with NACDS’ comments. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Section (1) of the proposed rule currently provides: “Pharmacies collecting con- trolled substances must comply with all applicable state and federal controlled substance laws.” The proposed language was intended to allow the collection of controlled substances as suggested by NACDS and MRA. To provide further clarity, the board has amended the rule title and section (1) of the rule to more clearly provide that Missouri pharmacies may accept controlled substances for destruction as authorized by, and in compliance with, state/federal law. 
20 CSR 2220-2.095 Collection of Medication for Destruction 
(1) Missouri licensed pharmacies may collect medication from the public for destruction in compliance with this rule. Pharmacies col- lecting controlled substances shall comply with all applicable state and federal controlled substance laws. Pharmacies collecting non- controlled substances shall comply with sections (2) to (9) of this rule. Participation in a medication return or destruction program is voluntary. This rule shall not be construed to require that a licensee or permit holder participate in or establish a return/destruction pro- gram.
