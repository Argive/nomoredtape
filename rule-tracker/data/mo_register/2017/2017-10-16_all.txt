Title 16—RETIREMENT SYSTEMS Division 10—The Public School Retirement System of Missouri Chapter 5—Retirement, Options and Benefits 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
16 CSR 10-5.010 Service Retirement. The Public School Retirement System of Missouri is amending sections (6) and (16) and adding sec- tion (20). 
PURPOSE: These amendments apply working after retirement rules to certain retirees who are employed by a third party or working as independent contractors, extend the time limit for certain retirees to name a new spouse as beneficiary, and add a divorce pop-up option to certain retirees. The proposed amendments are necessary due to recent amendments made to sections 169.560 and 169.141, RSMo. 
(6) Part-time employment is any employment which is less than full- time. Temporary-substitute employment is any employment either in a position held by a regularly employed person who is temporarily absent or in a position which is temporarily vacant. A retired mem- ber may be employed by a district included in the system to serve on a part-time or temporary-substitute basis in any capacity not to exceed five hundred fifty (550) hours in any one (1) school year and through such employment may earn an amount not in excess of the compensation limit set forth in this rule and section 169.560, RSMo, without a discontinuance of the retired member’s retirement allowance. The limit on compensation shall be determined as set forth in section 169.560, RSMo. If the position or positions did not previously exist, a retired member may earn up to fifty percent (50%) of the annual compensation payable for the position within the district that is most comparable to the position filled by the retired member without exceeding the compensation limit. If such employ- ment exceeds either the limitation on hours worked or the limitation on compensation, payment of benefits to the retired member shall cease until the employment terminates or a new school year begins. The provisions above shall apply to any person retired and cur- rently receiving a retirement allowance under sections 169.010, RSMo to 169.141, RSMo who is employed by a third party or is performing work as an independent contractor, if such person is performing work in a district included in the retirement system as a temporary or long-term substitute teacher or in any position that would normally require that person to be duly certificated by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education if such person was employed by the district. The retirement system may require the district, the third-party employer, the independent contractor, and the retiree, subject to this section, to provide documentation showing compliance with this section. If such documentation is not provided, the retire- ment system may deem the retiree to have exceeded the limita- tions provided in this section. This rule shall not apply to employ- ment with a state college, a state university, or any state agency. The employer covered by the Public School Retirement System of Missouri, the third-party employer, the independent contractor, and the retiree shall maintain a log of all dates worked, hours worked, wage earned, and the employer. The employer covered by the Public School Retirement System of Missouri, the third-party employer, the independent contractor, and retiree shall provide a copy of the work log upon request of retirement system. 
The working after retirement limits set forth in section 169.560, RSMo, shall be applied on a pro rata basis as provided below to a 
retiree’s hours of work during the school year in which the retiree’s date of retirement is effective. 
            
The working after retirement limits set forth in section 169.560, RSMo, shall be applied on a pro rata basis as provided below to a retiree’s base salary to determine the retiree’s earnings limit during the school year in which the retiree’s date of retirement is effective. 
            
(16) Any actuarial adjustment to a retirement allowance payment made because of the nomination of a successor beneficiary as provid- ed in 169.141, RSMo, shall take effect in the month a properly com- pleted nomination of successor beneficiary form is received by the Retirement System or the month of the retiree’s marriage to the suc- cessor beneficiary, whichever occurs later. The nomination of a suc- cessor beneficiary shall be effective immediately upon receipt by the Retirement System of the properly completed nomination of succes- sor beneficiary form or the date of the retiree’s marriage to the suc- cessor beneficiary, whichever occurs later. Effective August 28, 2017, the properly completed nomination of a successor benefi- ciary form submitted pursuant to section 169.141, RSMo must be received by the Retirement System within one (1) year of remar- riage of the retirement member and the new spouse. 
(20) Any member receiving a retirement allowance from the Public School Retirement System of Missouri who elected a reduced retirement allowance under subsection 3 of section 169.070, RSMo who, at the time of that election, named his or her spouse as the nominated beneficiary may have the retirement allowance increased to the amount the retired member would be receiving had the retired member elected Option 1 if the follow- ing requirements are met: 
(A) The marriage of the retired member and the nominated spouse must be dissolved on or after September 1, 2017. A dis- solution that occurred prior to September 1, 2017 that is modi- fied or amended on or after September 1, 2017 shall not satisfy the requirement that the marriage be dissolved on or after

Title 6—DEPARTMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION Division 255—Fertilizer Control Board Chapter 1—Organization and Description 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Fertilizer Control Board under section 266.336, RSMo 2016, the board adopts a rule as fol- lows: 
6 CSR 255-1.010 General Organization is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on July 3, 2017 (42 MoReg 964). No changes have been made in the text of the proposed rule, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: No comments were received. 
Title 6—DEPARTMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION Division 255—Fertilizer Control Board Chapter 10—Administration of Missouri Fertilizer Law 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Fertilizer Control Board under section 266.336, RSMo 2016, the board adopts a rule as fol- lows: 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on July 3, 2017 (42 MoReg 964–966). No changes have been made in the text of the pro- posed rule, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The board received two (2) com- ments on the proposed rule. 
COMMENT #1: Mr. Brian Hodges commented that as a fertilizer distributor the new fees will cost his company several hundred dol- lars. He asks that the board return to a tonnage fee of fifty cents (50¢) per ton. He also asked that the fifty dollar ($50) reporting fee be low- ered or dissolved. 
RESPONSE: In 2016, Missouri law created the Missouri Fertilizer Control Board and provided the board with authority to administer the fertilizer program and determine fees necessary for its adminis- tration. The board members are fertilizer distributors and fertilizer customers who also pay the fees levied by the board. While Missouri law allows tonnage fees of up to one dollar ($1.00) per ton, the board’s judgement was that sixty cents ($0.60) per ton is the proper level to administer the program at this time. In regards to the fifty dollar ($50) reporting fee, the board’s judgement was that there are administrative costs that the program incurs regardless of the number of tons reported. After taking all factors into account, the board con- tinues to believe these fees are appropriate. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #2: Mr. Randy Sprock commented that the fees are a new tax on small fertilizer businesses and this extra money will be used to help fund Missouri University in their time of financial trou- ble. 
RESPONSE: In 2016, Missouri law created the Missouri Fertilizer Control Board and provided the board with authority to administer the fertilizer program and determine how the program’s funds are to be expended. Using its best judgement, the board may or may not expend funds to procure goods and/or services from the University of Missouri. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment.

Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 65—Missouri Medicaid Audit and Compliance Chapter 3—Providers and Participants—General Provider and Participant Policies 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Department of Social Services under sections 208.159 and 660.017, RSMo 2016, the director adopts a rule as follows: 
13 CSR 65-3.050 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on May 15, 2017 (42 MoReg 781–782). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: Missouri Medicaid Audit and Compliance (MMAC), a unit within the Department of Social Services, received seven (7) comments on the proposed rule. Because of these comments, changes were made to this rule. 
COMMENT #1: Therap Services refers to the requirement in sub- section (6)(A) which requires only employees or designated agents of the provider to make entries in a participant’s electronic record or electronic medical record, suggesting that this requirement will pro- hibit self-advocates and family members from making entries in a participant’s record which it believed to be problematic if the partic- ipant self-medicated or otherwise contributed to his or her care. RESPONSE: If a participant self-medicates or otherwise contributes to his or her care, the participant will not be able to bill Medicaid for these activities and, therefore, will have no reason to submit a record, electronic or otherwise, to MO HealthNet. Family members approved to be care providers for certain programs are employees and subsection (6)(A) states employees may make entries. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENTS #2 and #3: Therap Services and Missouri Association of County Developmental Disabilities Services refer to the require- ment in paragraph (6)(D)3. that providers’ electronic records and electronic medical records system maintain an activity tracking sys- tem that records several items including “device identification, such as a Media Assigned Control (MAC) address.” Both providers rec- ommend adding “or IP address” to the device identifications. RESPONSE: The rule does not restrict providers to the MAC iden- tifications but merely gives it as an example and does not exclude use of the IP address as the device identification. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #4: Missouri Association of County Developmental Disabilities Services recommends that the word “electronic” be insert- ed prior to the word “signature” in subsections (7)(A) and (B). RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Subsections (7)(A) and (B) will be amended, for consistency, from “signature” to “electronic signature.” 
COMMENT #5: Missouri Association of County Developmental Disabilities Services refers to the requirement in section (9) that edits or changes to a record be saved and the record contain the date of, the reason for, and the author of the edit or change and asks if a record can state that an edit or change was made and reference documenta- tion supporting the reason for the change or note the reason for the change in another document that is linked to the electronic record. RESPONSE: The above-described processes would be allowable by the rule as written. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of the comment. 
requirement in section (8) that requires at least two (2) distinct iden- tification components be used when affixing an electronic signature and asks a two- (2-) part question. First, whether an electronic sig- nature must look like a “written signature” or a “signature simply typed in;” and second, whether the regulation is referring to the health care provider, the provider’s employee, or the participant. RESPONSE: With respect to the first part of the comment, subsec- tion (1)(C) defines “electronic signature” as a compilation of com- puter data used with the intent of being the legally binding equivalent of the individual’s handwritten signature. With respect to the second part of the comment, the requirement of section (8) applies to any electronic signature and when a requirement is specific to a party, the regulation so indicates as shown in section (7). No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #7: Missouri Alliance for Home Care refers to the requirement in subsection (6)(B) that requires all entries in a partici- pant’s electronic record or electronic medical record be authenticated by a method that identifies the author, including computer keys/codes, voice authentication systems, or other codes so long as they are under the sole control of the employee or agent using them. Missouri Alliance for Home Care recommends that “voice authentication” be replaced with “biometric identification” so that future technologies are included. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The phrase “voice authentication” will be replaced by the broader category of “biometric identification” to allow the regulation to adjust to technology without necessitating an amendment. 
13 CSR 65-3.050 Electronic Signatures for Mo HealthNet Program 
(6) Nothing herein shall require a provider to conduct business elec- tronically, but if a provider chooses to conduct business electronical- ly, the following requirements shall apply: 
(B) All entries in a participant’s electronic record or electronic medical record must be authenticated with a method established to identify the author. The method utilized may include computer keys/codes or biometric identification systems that utilize a personal identification number (PIN). When computer key/code(s), biometric identification systems, or other codes are used, these methods must be under the sole control of the employee or agent using them. Providers must be able to demonstrate that adequate safeguards are maintained to protect against improper or unauthorized use of these methods; 
(7) Electronic medical records shall contain the following: (A) The name, title, and electronic signature of the MO HealthNet 
enrolled provider delivering the service; and (B) The date the electronic signature was executed.
