Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

Title 7—DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Division 10—Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission Chapter 10—Contractor Performance Rating to Determine Responsibility 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
7 CSR 10-10.020 Explanation of Contractor Performance Rating System. The Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission is amending sections (1) and (2). 
PURPOSE: This proposed amendment corrects the statement that the commission does prequalify bidders. 
(1) The commission has the obligation to award its contracts to only responsive and responsible bidders.

product. [The commission does not prequalify persons or firms as responsible bidders and contractors.] Therefore, it requires a system for evaluating the performance of those contractors working on commission projects. 
(2) This contractor rating system is intended to help the commission periodically determine those contractors who are responsible or are nonresponsible and those responsible contractors whose outstanding or superior performance merits recognition by the commission. In the process, the rating system is intended to provide the contractors with evaluations of their work and information they can use to improve their performance [and product on future commission projects]. 
AUTHORITY: sections 226.020, 226.130, 227.030, and 227.100, [RSMo 1986 and 226.130,] RSMo [Supp. 1993] 2016. Original rule filed Dec. 31, 1990, effective July 8, 1991. Amended: Filed Dec. 8, 2016. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed amendment will not cost state agen- cies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed amendment will not cost private enti- ties more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed amendment with the Missouri Department of Transportation, Pamela Harlan, Secretary to the Commission, PO Box 270, Jefferson City, MO 65102. To be con- sidered, comments must be received within thirty (30) days after pub- lication of this notice in the Missouri Register. No public hearing is scheduled. 
Title 7—DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Division 10—Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission Chapter 10—Contractor Performance Rating to Determine Responsibility 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
7 CSR 10-10.030 Rating Categories for Evaluating the Performance of a Contractor. The Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission is amending sections (2) and (3). 
PURPOSE: This proposed amendment provides clarification to the rating process. 
(2) Each [project evaluation performance measure will be] of the four (4) categories will include performance and compliance questions that will be assigned [to a category and will have an applicable percentage deduct for non-performer. Performance measure responses will be completed according to the guide- lines shown on the project evaluation] scoring criteria. Not all [performance measures] questions will be applicable on each pro- ject’s evaluation and will, therefore, not be completed.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
7 CSR 10-10.070 Procedure for Annual Rating of Contractors. The Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission is amending section (4). 
PURPOSE: This proposed amendment clarifies the actions available to a contractor upon receiving an unacceptable rating. 
(4) Review Process. If the contractor disagrees with any performance measure finding on the contractor performance project evaluation and cannot resolve the dispute with the resident engineer, it may request in writing that the district engineer review the matter. Such request must be made to the district engineer within twenty-eight (28) days from the date of the mailing of the project evaluation to the contractor. However, the contractor’s representative shall first have discussed the project evaluation response with the resident engineer in order to resolve the dispute. Upon receiving the contractor’s writ- ten request to review the disputed performance measure finding on the project evaluation, the district engineer shall review the matter 
and provide the contractor with a written response regarding the par- ticular area of dispute between the contractor and the resident engi- neer. All reports shall be submitted to the construction and materials division before, but no later than, February 15. 
(A) “Unacceptable” Rating. No request for review to the contrac- tor performance review committee for an informal hearing or to the department regarding the contractors’ performance ratings is pro- vided under this chapter, with the exception of contractors who receive an unacceptable performance rating. 
1. The contractor must have received either an unacceptable cat- egory or overall performance rating and timely discussed the dispute with the resident engineer and made a timely written request for review by the district engineer of the particular unacceptable rating on the project evaluation that the contractor disagrees with as provid- ed in this chapter. 
2. If the contractor has complied with the requirements of para- graph (4)(A)1. above, the contractor shall have ten (10) working days to request an informal hearing to review an unacceptable category or overall performance rating. 
3. The contractor shall submit its request for an informal hear- ing to the following address: Missouri Department of Transportation, Construction and Materials Division, PO Box 270, Jefferson City, MO 65102. 
AUTHORITY: sections 226.020, 226.130, 227.030, and 227.105, RSMo [2000] 2016. Original rule filed Dec. 31, 1990, effective July 8, 1991. For intervening history, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Amended: Filed Dec. 8, 2016.

Title 7—DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Division 10—Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission Chapter 15—Contractor Prequalification 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
7 CSR 10-15.010 Prequalification to Bid of Certain Contractors. The Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission is amending sections (1) through (7). 
PURPOSE: This proposed amendment identifies that only electronic bids will be received and clarifies that the Construction and Materials Division is responsible for prequalification determinations. 
(1) Definitions. (A) The following definitions apply to this rule: 
1. “Commission” means the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission and all its members, jointly and severally; 2. “Department” means the Missouri Highways and Transportation Department, which may also be commonly referred to as the Missouri Department of Transportation. “Department” includes the chief engineer and all other officers and employees of 
 
January 17, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 2 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 89 

the department, unless the text of this rule clearly indicates a con- trary construction is intended; 
3. “Chief engineer” means the chief engineer of the depart- ment; or if that position is vacant, then it means the [deputy] assis- tant chief engineer; 
4. “Highway project” means any type or combination of exca- vation, construction, demolition, maintenance, fabrication, paving, dredging, repair, erection, electrical, landscaping, seeding and mulching, erosion control, installation, manufacturing, transporta- tion, or other work, done under a contract with the commission or department on or for any existing or proposed road, highway, or bridge in the Missouri state highway system; 
5. “Contract” means a written agreement between a contractor and the commission or department, including, but not limited to, a purchase order or similar writing. A contract may include two (2) or more different highway projects as part of a required or permissive combination; and 
6. “Cost estimate” means the contractor’s own estimate, in the form of a complete and responsive bid, submitted by a contractor for a highway project. [The contractor’s cost estimate may be adjusted for mathematical and clerical accuracy by the department. This adjustment by the department will be con- sidered to be part of the contractor’s cost estimate. A con- tractor’s bid (as adjusted) on a highway project is equivalent to that contractor’s cost estimate.] 
7. All bids shall be submitted electronically using the depart- ment’s electronic bidding process. 
(2) Application of this Rule. (A) This rule does not apply to— 
1. Any contractor which has a valid prequalification contractor questionnaire on file with the department, and which contractor (including, in the case of a partnership or joint venture, any compo- nent contractor) has performed any work for the department within the five (5) years preceding the date that contractor’s bid for any highway project, or combination of projects, shall be opened by the department; 
2. Any contractor which has a valid prequalification contractor questionnaire on file with the department, which has performed no work for the department within the five (5) years preceding the date that contractor’s bid for any highway project or combination of pro- jects shall be opened by the department, and which submits a bid (or cost estimate) on each individual highway project at or below two (2) million dollars; and 
3. A contractor which meets the requirements of either para- graph (2)(A)1. or 2. of this rule is exempt from having to be prequal- ified to bid under section 227.105, RSMo [(Cum. Supp. 1996)], effective August 28, 1996. 
(3) Contractor Prequalification Required to Submit Bid, When. (B) A bid (or cost estimate) on any highway project submitted by a contractor which is not prequalified or exempt from prequalifica- tion under subsection (2)(A) of this rule shall not be accepted by the department or commission[, but shall be returned to the con- tractor]. Acceptance by the department only occurs if the highway project bid of the contractor is received, opened, and the total bid publicly read by the department. [The fact that agents of the department and/or commission may have received a sealed bid envelope for a highway project(s), or may have opened that sealed bid envelope, does not constitute acceptance by the department or commission of that bid, unless and until the total bid is publicly read or published by the department.] If part of a combination bid is legally acceptable and another portion is not (such as in permissive combinations which are not qualified “All or none”), the department shall accept that portion which was legally bid and shall not accept the rest. If the department inadver- tently errs in accepting a bid on a highway project which it should not have accepted under this rule and section 227.105, RSMo 
[(Cum. Supp. 1996)], the department, prior to any contract award, shall notify all contractors which bid on that highway project and the commission of the erroneous acceptance of the bid from a contractor which was not properly prequalified under this rule, showing that the matter has been corrected, and that action shall render null and void the prior erroneous bid acceptance. 
(C) A contractor which is neither [qualified] prequalified nor exempt from qualification under this rule may be prequalified by sat- isfying the specific criteria set forth below in section (4) of this rule. 
(4) Contractor Prequalification Responsibility. (B) Submitting the Prequalification Contractor Questionnaire to 
the Department. 1. The prequalification contractor questionnaire must be com- 
pleted fully and accurately, personally signed and notarized, and mailed or delivered (including electronic means) to the department so that it is received by the appropriate departmental staff no less than seven (7) calendar days prior to the date and hour the contractor anticipates bidding on any Missouri highway project. However, if the contractor already has a standard contractor questionnaire on file with the department, it may bid on any Missouri highway project which the contractor’s bid estimates will cost two (2) million dollars or below. 
2. The prequalification contractor questionnaire must be mailed or delivered to: 
Division Engineer, [Design] Construction and Materials Missouri Department of Transportation [105 W. Capitol Avenue] 1617 Missouri Boulevard P[.]O[.] Box 270 
Jefferson City, MO 65102-0270 (C) Delivery may be in person, by a representative or agent, or by 
any United States Postal Service or express delivery company, with- out restriction, or electronically, as long as it is complete and received in the appropriate office of the department no later than seven (7) calendar days prior to the date and hour the contractor’s bid will be opened by the department. 
(E) The contractor will be notified in writing if the prequalification contractor questionnaire is incomplete or insufficient in any respect. If practicable, notification will be made by facsimile transmission as well as by first class United States mail, or electronically, so that the con- tractor is aware of the problem prior to submitting any highway pro- ject bid to the department. 
(5) Departmental Review and Contractor Prequalification. (B) If, in the discretion of the designated staff of the department, the contractor’s prequalification contractor questionnaire and attach- ments show that the contractor should be qualified to bid on highway projects of the type(s) the contractor has requested prequalification for, the department will notify the contractor in writing by first class United States mail, and/or electronically. The department may also notify the contractor by phone or facsimile transmission if a highway project bid opening date is approaching, but there is no obligation upon the department to do so. The contractor may also contact the department by phone, facsimile transmission, or electronically, or in writing, to confirm that its prequalification contractor questionnaire 
has been approved. (C) If, in the discretion of the designated staff of the department, 
the contractor’s prequalification contractor questionnaire and attach- ments do not show that the contractor is qualified to bid on any one (1) or more of the type(s) of highway project for which the contractor has requested prequalification, that departmental staff shall notify the contractor applicant in writing, or electronically, that the application is still undergoing review, and shall refer the matter to the chief engi- neer; or if the chief engineer is unavailable, the [deputy] assistant chief engineer; or if they are unavailable, to the [assistant chief] appropriate division engineer[, design]. That individual shall make the final administrative decision on behalf of the department, as to whether the contractor is or is not prequalified to bid on any or 

Page 90 
Proposed Rules 
January 17, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 2 
all types of highway projects for which prequalification is requested. That individual shall act no later than twenty-one (21) calendar days after the date the completed prequalification contractor questionnaire with all attachments was received. [No further appeal or review within the department is available.] 
(D) If a contractor is dissatisfied with the final administrative deci- sion made by the department on its prequalification contractor ques- tionnaire, the contractor may request in writing, or electronically, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the date of mailing by the department of the administrative review that the commission review the final administrative decision made by the department. A contrac- tor is not obligated to seek commission review in order to preserve its rights. Any request for commission review shall be made [in trip- licate writing] to: 
Commission Secretary Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission 105 West Capitol Avenue P[.]O[.] Box 270 Jefferson City, MO 65102-0270 
The request for review shall state specifically and completely the legal and factual basis upon which the contractor believes its prequal- ification application was denied in error. [No new documentation or information may be submitted at this time which was not made a part of the originally-filed prequalification contractor questionnaire.] At the commission’s sole discretion, the commis- sion shall decide if it wishes to review the final departmental deci- sion. If the commission elects to itself review that decision, it shall make its review when it deems best, upon the records and documents in the possession of the department. There will be no further brief- ing, personal appearance, argument, or presentation to the commis- sion by the contractor or its representative, agent, or attorney. The commission’s decision on that record shall supersede the prior deci- sion of the department, and shall then constitute the final administra- tive decision. If the commission elects in its sole discretion to not review the department’s decision, then that departmental decision shall stand as the final administrative decision. 
(6) Effect of Contractor Prequalification. (E) Any contractor which files a prequalification contractor ques- 
tionnaire unnecessarily, because it has done highway project work for the department or commission within at least the last four (4) years, will not have the questionnaire rejected for that reason. Instead, the contractor will be informed in writing, or electronically, that its con- tractor questionnaire has been accepted, and that the contractor could have filed a standard contractor questionnaire instead. 
(7) Miscellaneous Provisions. (A) All information submitted by a contractor, its bonding compa- 
ny or others to the department relevant to a determination of mini- mum qualifications to bid under section 227.105, RSMo [(Cum. Supp. 1996)], and all information used by the department to deter- mine the contractor’s prequalification to bid under that statute and this rule, is protected from disclosure pursuant to the provisions of that statute and section 610.021, RSMo [(Supp. 1995), as it may be amended]. 
(B) The provisions of this rule are intended to be severable. If any provision is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unlawful, or unconstitutional, the remaining provisions of the rule are intended to be valid unless the court finds the valid provisions of the rule are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so dependent upon, the void provision that it cannot be presumed the commission would have promulgated the valid provisions without the void one; or unless the court finds that the valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are incapable of being executed in accor- dance with the commission’s intent or with section 227.105, RSMo [(Cum. Supp. 1996)].

Title 19—DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SENIOR SERVICES Division 10—Office of the Director Chapter 10—Vital Records 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services under sections 193.035, 193.045, and 193.128, RSMo 2016, the department adopts a rule as follows:

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) received comments from forty (40) individ- uals, and two (2) comments were made by DHSS staff. 
COMMENT #1: Fran Kovach sent a letter of comment voicing a gen- eral objection to an emergency or proposed rule that would restrict adopted adults from access to their original birth certificate, identity information, and medical information. 
RESPONSE: The emergency and proposed rules are identical and are consistent with the Missouri Adoptee Rights Act (HB 1599). No changes have been made to this rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #2: Kathleen Murphy Lang, Lyn (last name not provid- ed), and Don Phillips sent comments voicing a general objection to the emergency rule filed regarding HB 1599 because of concern that the rule changes the law. 
RESPONSE: The emergency and proposed rules are identical and are consistent with the Missouri Adoptee Rights Act (HB 1599). No changes have been made to this rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #3: Dianne and Ed Magnusson, Bryan Cummins, Roger Cummins, Sharon Cummins, Alina Cummins, Deborah Lynn Staley, Danika Donatti, Deb L. Donatti, James Donatti, Gloria Dawson, Debra L. Olson, Joseph M. Bax, Sue H. Bax, Jeanette C. Mooney, Heather Dodd, Mary Helen Allen, Adoption Triad Connection of Mid MO, Gary Ellison, Cindy Farmer, Andy Farmer, Judy Ellison, Patti Naumann, Janet Hood, R.L. Bennett, Glenda L. Bennett, John D. Dukewits, Jr., Judith Bock, Stanley A. Schultz, Karen Koeneker, Ron Cummins, Romaine Cummins, Carolyn Pooler, Raymond Pooler, and Judith Taylor expressed concern that wording in the pur- pose statement regarding the process for a birth parent to express their contact preference is an attempt to change the law by allowing the birth parents to dictate contact rights rather than express their contact “preference”. The purpose statement currently reads: “This rule provides the process for an adoptee to receive a copy of his or her original birth certificate, the process for a birth parent to state his or her perference regarding whether and how the adoptee can contact him or her, and the process of completion of a medical history form by a birth parent.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Upon consider- ation of these comments, the department has changed the purpose statement to more accurately reflect the content of the rule. 
COMMENT #4: Dianne and Ed Magnusson, Bryan Cummins, Roger Cummins, Sharon Cummins, Alina Cummins, Deborah Lynn Staley, Danika Donatti, Deb L. Donatti, James Donatti, Gloria Dawson, Debra L. Olson, Joseph M. Bax, Sue H. Bax, Jeanette C. Mooney, Heather Dodd, Mary Helen Allen, Adoption Triad Connection of Mid MO, Gary Ellison, Cindy Farmer, Andy Farmer, Judy Ellison, Patti Naumann, Janet Hood, R.L. Bennett, Glenda L. Bennett, John D. Dukewits, Jr., Judith Bock, Stanley A. Schultz, Karen Koeneker, Ron Cummins, Romaine Cummins, Carolyn Pooler, and Raymond Pooler expressed concern that the law already defines “identifying information,” but the rule is redefining this term only for the sake of this specific law and is therefore discriminating against adopted adults. 
RESPONSE: The Missouri Adoptee Rights Act (HB 1599) did not define “identifying information.” The data elements defined as iden- tifying information for purposes of this rule would directly or indi- rectly identify the birth parent. No changes have been made to this rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #5: Dianne and Ed Magnusson, Bryan Cummins, Roger Cummins, Sharon Cummins, Alina Cummins, Deborah Lynn Staley, Danika Donatti, Deb L. Donatti, James Donatti, Gloria Dawson, Debra L. Olson, Joseph M. Bax, Sue H. Bax, Jeanette C. Mooney, Heather Dodd, Mary Helen Allen, Adoption Triad Connection of Mid MO, Gary Ellison, Cindy Farmer, Andy Farmer, Judy Ellison, Patti Naumann, Janet Hood, R.L. Bennett, Glenda L. Bennett, John D. Dukewits, Jr., Judith Bock, Stanley A. Schultz, Karen Koeneker, Ron Cummins, Romaine Cummins, Carolyn Pooler, and Raymond Pooler expressed concern that the law already defines “attorney,” but the rule is redefining this term only for the sake of this specific law and is therefore discriminating against adopted adults. 
RESPONSE: The term “attorney” is not defined in Missouri law. For purposes of this rule, attorney is defined as a currently-licensed member of the Missouri Bar or bar of another state of the United States. The definition ensures DHSS only releases information to an individual who legally represents the individual and has a direct and tangible interest as required under section 193.255, RSMo, and 19 CSR 10-10.090 in order to obtain vital records. No changes have been made to this rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #6: Dianne and Ed Magnusson, Bryan Cummins, Roger Cummins, Sharon Cummins, Alina Cummins, Deborah Lynn Staley, Judy Kenett, Archie M. Hyde, Danika Donatti, Deb L. Donatti, James Donatti, Gloria Dawson, Debra L. Olson, Joseph M. Bax, Sue H. Bax, Jeanette C. Mooney, Heather Dodd, Mary Helen Allen, Adoption Triad Connection of Mid MO, Gary Ellison, Cindy Farmer, Andy Farmer, Judy Ellison, Patti Naumann, Janet Hood, R.L. Bennett, Glenda L. Bennett, John D. Dukewits, Jr., Robin Marlin, Judith Bock, Stanley A. Schultz, Karen Koeneker, Ron Cummins, Romaine Cummins, Carolyn Pooler, Raymond Pooler, and Judith Taylor expressed concern that the rule is not in compliance with the Missouri Adoptee Rights Act and conflicts with section 453.121, RSMo. 
RESPONSE: The rule is consistent with the Missouri Adoptee Rights Act (HB 1599). Nothing in the Missouri Adoptee Rights Act or this rule will affect the provisions of section 453.121, RSMo. No changes have been made to this rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #7: A comment was made by a staff member of DHSS indicating concern that the department or an employee of the depart- ment may be listed as the intermediary on the Birth Parent Contact Preference Form. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: DHSS is amending the form to indicate that neither DHSS nor an employee of DHSS working in his/her capacity as a DHSS employee may be listed as the intermediary on the Birth Parent Contact Preference Form. The form date has been updated in section (2) of the rule. 
COMMENT #8: DHSS staff commented that the adoptee may have

Orders of Rulemaking 

additional information that may assist DHSS in locating the correct original birth certificate for the adoptee and the Application for Non- Certified Copy of an Original Birth Certificate form should include a space for providing additional information. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: DHSS is amending the Application for Non-Certified Copy of an Original Birth Certificate form referenced in sections (4) and (5) to add space for additional information the adoptee may wish to provide to assist DHSS in locating the correct original birth certificate for the adoptee. The form date has been updated in sections (4) and (5) of the rule.
