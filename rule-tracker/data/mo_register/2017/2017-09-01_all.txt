Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 12—DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE Division 10—Director of Revenue Chapter 23—Motor Vehicle 
EMERGENCY RULE 
12 CSR 10-23.600 Complaint, Inspection, and Disciplinary Process for Transportation Network Companies 
PURPOSE: This rule clarifies application, inspection, and discipli- nary processes and procedures related to transportation network companies. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The Department of Revenue determined that this emergency rule is necessary to preserve a compelling gov- ernmental interest and to protect the public health, safety, and wel- fare of Missouri drivers on the public highways. 
Sections 387.400 to 387.440, RSMo, create a regulatory frame- work for the licensure of transportation network companies (TNC) desiring to operate in Missouri. Through these licensed TNCs, thou- sands of independent contractor drivers will provide transportation services to citizens across the state. TNCs are required under sections 387.418 and 387.420, RSMo, to properly vet drivers prior to autho- rizing the driver to engage in transporting citizens and investigate intoxication-related complaints received by citizens. TNCs are also required under section 387.436, RSMo, to report driver disqualifica- tions to the department, so that the department may then notify any other licensed TNCs. 
The Department of Revenue and Missouri citizens need this emer- gency rule to ensure that these transportation services are performed safely and effectively by authorized drivers. This emergency rule clar- ifies application, notification, and inspection procedures which will allow the department to provide notification of driver disqualifica- tions, determine compliance with sections 387.400 to 387.440, RSMo, and further ensure TNCs are afforded due process by estab- lishing procedures on appeals for actions taken against a TNC under section 387.440, RSMo. 
The Department of Revenue finds there is a compelling governmen- tal interest and further finds an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, which requires this emergency action. A proposed rule, which covers the same material, was published in the August 15, 2017, issue of the Missouri Register. The scope of this emergency rule is limited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The Department of Revenue believes this emergency rule is fair to all interested persons and parties under the circum- stances. This emergency rule was filed July 27, 2017, becomes effec- tive August 28, 2017, and expires February 23, 2018.

(A) The following acts constitute cause for refusal to issue or renew a license: 
1. Any violation of sections 387.400 to 387.440, RSMo, sec- tions 379.1700 to 379.1708, RSMo, or any rule promulgated under the authority delegated to the department under section 387.430, RSMo; 
2. The applicant or license holder was previously the holder of a license issued under sections 387.400 to 387.440, RSMo, which license was suspended or denied for cause and was never reissued by the department; 
3. The applicant or license holder was previously a partner, stockholder, director, or officer controlling or managing a partner- ship or corporation whose license issued under sections 387.400 to 387.440, RSMo, was suspended or denied for cause and was never reissued; 
4. Use of fraud, deception, misrepresentation, or bribery in securing a license issued pursuant to sections 387.400 to 387.440, RSMo; and 
5. Failure to cooperate with the department or failure to timely respond to a request for records by the department in connection with an investigation. 
(6) To the extent permitted by section 387.440, RSMo, a home rule city or the commission may assess a fine of up to five-hundred dol- lars ($500) to a TNC for failure to comply with sections 387.400 to 387.440, RSMo, and shall comply with all notification requirements contained in this section. 
(A) The home rule city or the commission shall send a notice to the TNC’s registered agent which includes the amount of the fine, a brief statement of facts establishing the TNC’s failure to comply with any requirement in sections 387.400 to 387.440, RSMo, and a state- ment indicating the right of appeal in substantially the following lan- guage: “If you are adversely affected by this notice, you may appeal to the department of revenue. To appeal, you must file a request for hearing with the Department of Revenue, PO Box 703, Jefferson City, MO 65105, within thirty (30) days after the date this notice was mailed or the date it was delivered, whichever date was earlier. If any 
such request for hearing is sent by registered mail or certified mail, it will be deemed filed on the date it is mailed; if it is sent by any method other than registered mail or certified mail, it will be deemed filed on the date it is received by the Department of Revenue.” A copy of the notice must be provided to the department upon issuance by mailing it to Department of Revenue, PO Box 703, Jefferson City, MO 65105 or by sending it electronically to mvbmail@dor.mo.gov. 
1. Any TNC fined by a home rule city or the commission shall be entitled to a hearing before the director by filing a request for hearing with the department within thirty (30) days after the date this notice was mailed or the date it was delivered, whichever date was earlier. If the request for hearing is sent by registered mail or certi- fied mail, it will be deemed filed on the date it is mailed; if it is sent by any method other than registered mail or certified mail, it will be deemed filed on the date it is received by the Department of Revenue. 
2. Failure to file a timely request for hearing will be considered a waiver of the right to an administrative hearing and will establish and make final, for the purposes of administrative appeal, the home rule city or the commission’s factual findings and fines. 
(B) Hearings will be held in Jefferson City, Missouri, and shall be considered contested cases as that term is defined in Chapter 536, RSMo. Hearings will be placed on an administrative docket in the order in which they are received. 
(C) Parties will be notified by first class mail of the date and time of the hearing. A copy of the notice will be sent to each party or the party’s attorney of record. 
(D) Parties may be allowed one (1) continuance at the discretion of the director provided good cause is shown. All requests for con- tinuances shall be made in writing, state good cause for the continu- ance, and be signed and verified by the party making the request or their attorney of record. All requests for continuance must be filed at least five (5) days prior to the date of the scheduled hearing. 
(E) The department will make a record of the proceedings and evi- dence presented. Hearing procedures shall be substantially as fol- lows:

Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 70—MO HealthNet Division Chapter 10—Nursing Home Program 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 
13 CSR 70-10.016 Global Per Diem Adjustments to Nursing Facility and HIV Nursing Facility Reimbursement Rates. The division is adding paragraph (3)(A)21. 
PURPOSE: This amendment provides for a per diem decrease to nursing facility and HIV nursing facility per diem reimbursement rates of five dollars and thirty-seven cents ($5.37) effective for dates of service beginning August 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018. The per diem decrease shall be reduced to four dollars and eighty-three cents ($4.83) effective for dates of service beginning July 1, 2018. This per diem decrease corresponds to the appropriation granted in the State Fiscal Year 2018 budget, approved by the governor, and is contingent upon approval by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The Department of Social Services, MO HealthNet Division, by rule and regulation, must define the reason- able costs, manner, extent, quantity, quality, charges and fees of medical assistance. Effective for State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2018, the appropriation reduced the funds available for nursing facilities’ and HIV nursing facilities’ reimbursements. The MO HealthNet Division is carrying out the reduction by providing for a per diem decrease for nursing facility and HIV nursing facility reimbursement rates by decreasing the per diem by five dollars and thirty-seven cents ($5.37) effective for dates of service beginning August 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018. The per diem decrease shall be reduced to four dollars and eighty-three cents ($4.83) effective for dates of service beginning July 1, 2018. The rate decrease is necessary to ensure that payments for nursing facility and HIV nursing facility per diem rates are in line with the funds appropriated for that purpose. There is a total of five hundred and three (503) nursing facilities and HIV nursing facilities currently enrolled in MO HealthNet which will be subject to a per diem decrease in its reimbursement rate effective for dates of service beginning August 1, 2017. This emergency amendment will ensure payment for nursing facility and HIV nursing facility services to approximately twenty-four thousand (24,000) senior Missourians in accordance with the appropriation authority. For the SFY 2018 pay- ment to be made, a Medicaid State Plan Amendment is required to be submitted and approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). This emergency amendment must be implemented on a timely basis to ensure that quality nursing facility and HIV nursing facility services continue to be provided to MO HealthNet partici- pants in nursing facilities and HIV nursing facilities during SFY 2018 in accordance with the appropriation authority. As a result, the MO HealthNet Division finds an immediate danger to public health, safe- ty and/or welfare and a compelling governmental interest, which requires emergency action. The MO HealthNet Division has a com- pelling governmental interest in providing continued cash flow for nursing facility and HIV nursing facility services. The scope of this emergency amendment is limited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended by the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The MO HealthNet Division believes this emergency amendment is fair to all interested 
persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency amend- ment was filed July 21, 2017, becomes effective August 1, 2017, and expires February 22, 2018. 
(3) Adjustments to the Reimbursement Rates. Subject to the limita- tions prescribed in 13 CSR 70-10.015, a nursing facility’s reimburse- ment rate may be adjusted as described in this section. Subject to the limitations prescribed in 13 CSR 70-10.080, an HIV nursing facili- ty’s reimbursement rate may be adjusted as described in this section. 
(A) Global Per Diem Rate Adjustments. A facility with either an interim rate or a prospective rate may qualify for the global per diem rate adjustments. Global per diem rate adjustments shall be added to the specified cost component ceiling. 
1. FY-96 negotiated trend factor— A. Facilities with either an interim rate or prospective rate in 
effect on October 1, 1995, shall be granted an increase to their per diem effective October 1, 1995, of four and six-tenths percent (4.6%) of the cost determined in paragraphs (11)(A)1., (11)(B)1., (11)(C)1., and the property insurance and property taxes detailed in subsection (11)(D) of 13 CSR 70-10.015; or 
B. Facilities that were granted a prospective rate based on paragraph (12)(A)2. of 13 CSR 70-10.015 that is in effect on October 1, 1995, shall have their increase determined by subsection (3)(S) of 13 CSR 70-10.015. 
2. FY-97 negotiated trend factor— A. Facilities with either an interim rate or prospective rate in 
effect on October 1, 1996, shall be granted an increase to their per diem effective October 1, 1996, of three and seven-tenths percent (3.7%) of the cost determined in paragraphs (11)(A)1., (11)(B)1., (11)(C)1., and the property insurance and property taxes detailed in subsection (11)(D) of 13 CSR 70-10.015; or

4. Minimum wage adjustment. All facilities with either an inter- im rate or a prospective rate in effect on November 1, 1996, shall be granted an increase to their per diem effective November 1, 1996, of two dollars and forty-five cents ($2.45) to allow for the change in minimum wage. Utilizing Fiscal Year 1995 cost report data, the total industry hours reported for each payroll category was multiplied by the fifty-cent (50¢) increase, divided by the patient days for the facil- ities reporting hours for that payroll category, and factored up by eight and sixty-seven hundredths percent (8.67%) to account for the related increase to payroll taxes. This calculation excludes the direc- tor of nursing, the administrator, and assistant administrator. 
5. Minimum wage adjustment. All facilities with either an inter- im rate or a prospective rate in effect on September 1, 1997, shall be granted an increase to their per diem effective September 1, 1997, of one dollar and ninety-eight cents ($1.98) to allow for the change in minimum wage. Utilizing Fiscal Year 1995 cost report data, the total industry hours reported for each payroll category was multiplied by the forty-cent (40¢) increase, divided by the patient days for the facil- ities reporting hours for that payroll category, and factored up by eight and sixty-seven hundredths percent (8.67%) to account for the related increase to payroll taxes. This calculation excludes the direc- tor of nursing, the administrator, and assistant administrator. 
6. FY-98 negotiated trend factor— A. Facilities with either an interim rate or prospective rate in 
effect on October 1, 1997, shall be granted an increase to their per diem effective October 1, 1997, of three and four-tenths percent (3.4%) of the cost determined in paragraphs (11)(A)1., (11)(B)1., (11)(C)1., and the property insurance and property taxes detailed in subsection (11)(D) of 13 CSR 70-10.015 for nursing facilities and 13

Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2220—State Board of Pharmacy Chapter 2—General Rules 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2220-2.650 Standards of Operation for a Class J: Shared 
Services Pharmacy. The board is amending paragraph (1)(A)3. and adding new section (2). 
PURPOSE: This rule is being amended to accommodate pharmacies dispensing medication to another pharmacy for administration by a licensed healthcare professional. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The current rule establishes mandatory requirements for pharmacies engaged in Class-J Shared Services pharmacies. The board currently issues sixteen (16) classes of phar- macy permits (Class-A to Class-P). Pharmacies are required to have a pharmacy permit for each type of pharmacy service performed. As a result, many pharmacies have multiple classes of licensure. A Class-J pharmacy permit is required for pharmacies filling, dispens- ing, or transferring medication/filled prescriptions to another phar- macy for dispensing to the patient. 
In April 2017, the board received comments from Missouri hospi- tals and specialty pharmacies indicating the current Class-J require- ments are detrimentally impacting patient care by effectively prohibit- ing the dispensing of medication to Missouri patients with complex, chronic, or rare diseases who are participating in certain patient assistance programs. Specifically, Missouri hospital and specialty pharmacies reported that an increased number of patient assistance programs and third party payors now mandate that certain high risk, high-cost medications can only be prepared/dispensed by a specialty pharmacy and shipped to another licensed pharmacy where it has to be administered to the patient on-site of the receiving pharmacy by a healthcare provider. A number of these medications are reportedly high-cost items while others require specialized pharmacist training or expertise to prepare. 
To ship medication to another pharmacy, both the specialty pharma- cy and the receiving pharmacy are required to have a Class-J Shared Services permit. A number of hospital/specialty pharmacies have indi- cated they are unable to apply for a Class-J permit primarily because of the rule’s requirements that Class-J pharmacies: 1) have the same owner or have a pre-existing contract for shared services and 2) share a common electronic database that provides real-time, online access. Specifically, specialty/hospital pharmacies reported the patient may require medication before a contract can be negotiated with the corre- sponding pharmacy. In some instances, the receiving pharmacy may be unknown or have no business relationship with the specialty pharmacy until medication is required. In other instances, expensive software purchases would be required to render the electronic systems accessi- ble or compliant. 
Due to the Class-J licensing requirements, patients have been unable to procure medication provided by certain assistance programs from designated hospital/specialty pharmacies located throughout the state. In some instances, patients have reportedly been turned away or denied medication because the participating pharmacies could not obtain a Class-J permit. The board was informed Missouri cancer patients have been particularly impacted and denied/delayed medica- tion services. Significantly, some of the medications discussed with the board are not dispensed by community/ambulatory pharmacies due, in part, to the required expertise, equipment, and training needed to compound these preparations and/or due to the related medication costs which can reportedly exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) per year in some cases. 
After the April 2017 meeting, the board formed a sub-committee to immediately review and draft proposed revisions to the current rule. As part of this process, the board consulted with hospital and specialty pharmacy advocates to draft language that would allow shipment of patient medication between licensed pharmacies without a Class-J pharmacy permit while maintaining appropriate safeguards to protect patient health. The board also consulted with the statutorily authorized Missouri Hospital Advisory Committee in June of 2017. The board is proposing this emergency amendment to allow continued dispensing to lower-income, uninsured Missouri patients by modifying Class-J licensing requirements for pharmacies transferring medication that 

September 1, 2017 Page 1228 Vol. 42, No. 17 

Emergency Rules 

will be administered on-site of the pharmacy by a health care practi- tioner. Significantly, the Class-J permit is an additional class of licensure. Pharmacies engaged in the affected conduct would still be required to hold a board pharmacy permit in another classification. 
Absent an amendment, the board’s rule would significantly and adversely affect patient health and patient access to care by prohibit- ing pharmacies unable to qualify for a Class-J Shared Services phar- macy permit from dispensing designated medication to lower- income/uninsured patients participating in patient assistance pro- grams. Once again, some of these medications may be unavailable from a traditional retail pharmacy and/or otherwise unaffordable for the targeted patient population. 
As a result, the Missouri State Board of Pharmacy finds there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, and/or welfare and a compelling governmental interest that requires this emergency action. A proposed amendment, which covers the same material, is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. The scope of this emergency amendment is limited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The Missouri State Board of Pharmacy believes this emergency amendment is fair to all inter- ested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency amendment was filed July 27, 2017, becomes effective August 6, 2017, and expires February 22, 2018. 
(1) Class J: Shared Services: Shared Service Pharmacy is defined as the processing by a pharmacy of a request from another pharmacy to fill or refill a prescription drug order, or that performs or assists in the performance of functions associated with the dispensing process, drug utilization review (DUR), claims adjudication, refill authoriza- tions, and therapeutic interventions. 
(A) A pharmacy may perform or outsource centralized prescrip- tion processing services provided the parties:

2. Maintain separate licenses for each location involved in pro- viding shared services; and 
3. [Share a common electronic file to allow access to suf- ficient information necessary or required to fill or refill a pre- scription drug order.] Either share a common database or allow access to each pharmacy’s electronic medication or prescription records. The access must provide real-time, online access to the patient’s complete profile for the pharmacies involved. 
(2) A Class J Shared services permit shall not be required if a completed and labeled prescription is delivered from a Missouri licensed pharmacy to another Missouri licensed pharmacy for administration by a pharmacist or other licensed health care pro- fessional to the patient on the same premises or physical location as the pharmacy. 
(A) The exemption recognized in this subsection only applies if a completed and labeled prescription is delivered to the receiving pharmacy. 
(B) If additional manipulation or compounding is required by the receiving pharmacy, receipt of a prescription or order is required and the receiving pharmacy must dispense the product as their own prescription/order. All prescription requirements, record keeping, compounding, and labeling requirements must be met.

(D) The receiving pharmacy is responsible for ensuring compli- ance with all applicable patient counseling requirements. 
applying or introducing medication to the body of a patient, whether by injection, infusion, inhalation, ingestion, or other means. 
(F) Medication administered by a pharmacist must be per- formed in compliance with all applicable provisions of law. 
(G) Notwithstanding any other provision of this rule, licensees shall comply with all applicable controlled substance laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, all applicable security and record keeping requirements.

This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2220—State Board of Pharmacy Chapter 2—General Rules 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
20 CSR 2220-2.650 Standards of Operation for a Class J: Shared Services Pharmacy. The board is amending the purpose statement and section (1) of the rule and adding new sections (2), (3), and (4). 
PURPOSE: The board is amending section (1) and adding new sec- tions (2) to (4) to update the rule, clarify database/contracting requirements, and to accommodate pharmacies dispensing medica- tion to another pharmacy for administration by a licensed healthcare professional. 
PURPOSE: The purpose of this rule is to establish [minimum stan- dards of operation for Class J: Shared Services Pharmacy, in compliance with House Bill 567 of the 91st General Assembly] standards for Class J: Shared Services pharmacies. 
(1) Class J: Shared Services: [Shared Service Pharmacy is defined as the processing by a pharmacy of a request from another pharmacy to fill or refill a prescription drug order, or that performs or assists in the performance of functions associated with the dispensing process, drug utilization review (DUR), claims adjudication, refill authorizations, and therapeutic interventions.] A Class J Shared Services permit is required if two (2) or more pharmacies are engaged in, or have an arrangement to provide, functions related to the practice of pharmacy for or on behalf of the other pharmacy. These func- tions may include, but are not limited to: prescription/order receipt, prescription/order clarification or modification, obtain- ing prescriber authorization, data entry, compounding, dispens- ing, pharmacist verification, patient counseling, patient profile maintenance, medication therapy services, medication adminis- tration, drug utilization review (DUR), and obtaining refill authorization. Both pharmacies participating in the shared ser- vices arrangement must have a Class J permit. 
(A) [A pharmacy may perform or outsource centralized prescription processing services provided the parties:] Pharmacies may perform Class-J Shared Services provided the parties— 
1. Have the same owner, or have a written contract outlining the services to be provided and the responsibilities [and accountabili- ties] of each party in fulfilling the terms of said contract in compli- ance with federal and state laws and regulations; 
2. Maintain [separate licenses] a separate Class-J classifi- cation for each location involved in providing shared services; and 
3. [Share a common electronic file to allow access to suf- ficient information necessary or required to fill or refill a pre- scription drug order.] Either share a common database or allow access to each pharmacy’s electronic medication or prescription records. The access must provide real-time, online access to the patient’s complete profile for the pharmacies involved. 
[(B) There must be record keeping systems between shared service pharmacies with real time on-line access to shared services by both pharmacies. Transfer of prescription information between two (2) pharmacies that are accessing the same real-time, on-line database pursuant to the opera- tion of a shared service pharmacy operation shall not be con- sidered a prescription transfer and, therefore, is not subject to the requirements of 4 CSR 220-2.120. 
(C) The parties performing or contracting for centralized prescription processing services shall maintain a policy and procedures manual and documentation that implementation 
is occurring in a manner that shall be made available to the board for review upon request and that includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
1. A description of how the parties will comply with federal and state laws and regulations; 
2. The maintenance of appropriate records to identify the responsible pharmacist(s) in the dispensing and counsel- ing processes; 
3. The maintenance of a mechanism for tracking the prescription drug order during each step in the process; 
4. The provision of adequate security to protect the confidentiality and integrity of patient information; 
5. The maintenance of a quality assurance program for pharmacy services designed to objectively and systematical- ly monitor and evaluate the quality and appropriateness of patient care, pursue opportunities to improve patient care, and resolve identified problems.] 
(B) Class-J pharmacies operating in compliance with this sec- tion are exempt from the requirements of 20 CSR 2220-2.120 and 20 CSR 2220-6.030(4) when transferring prescription informa- tion between themselves. A Class-J permit is not required to transfer an individual prescription as authorized by 20 CSR 2220-2.120 pursuant to a request by the patient or the patient’s authorized designee. 
(C) The parties performing Class-J Shared services shall main- tain a detailed written description of authorized shared services that includes the name, address, and permit number(s) of all pharmacies involved. The parties must maintain a current and accurate policy and procedure manual that includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
1. Policies and procedures that identify the duties of each pharmacy including any functions identified in section (1); 
2. A mechanism for tracking the prescription or medication order during each step in the process; 
3. Security provisions for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of patient information; 
4. Policies and procedures to ensure the safe and appropri- ate delivery of prescription drugs in compliance with 20 CSR 2220-2.013; and 
5. A designation of the pharmacy responsible for offering patient counseling as required by 20 CSR 2220-2.190 and federal law. For purposes of section 338.059, RSMo, either the name and address of the pharmacy responsible for offering patient counsel- ing or the pharmacy responsible for dispensing to the patient may be listed on the label as designated by the pharmacies by con- tract. 
(D) Each pharmacy involved in a Class-J arrangement must maintain a quality assurance program that is designed to objec- tively and systematically monitor and evaluate the quality and appropriateness of pharmacy services and resolve identified problems. 
(E) Compounding may only be performed pursuant to a Class- J pharmacy arrangement pursuant to a patient-specific prescrip- tion or in anticipation of a patient-specific prescription as autho- rized by 20 CSR 2220-2.200 and the rules of the board. 
(F) A Class-J permit is not required for pharmacists perform- ing non-dispensing activities authorized by 20 CSR 2220-6.050 outside of a licensed pharmacy. 
(2) A Class J Shared services permit shall not be required if a completed and labeled prescription is delivered from a Missouri licensed pharmacy to another Missouri licensed pharmacy for administration by a pharmacist or other licensed health care pro- fessional to the patient on the same premises or physical location as the pharmacy. 
(A) The exemption recognized in this subsection only applies if a completed and labeled prescription is delivered to the receiving pharmacy.

Missouri Register 
Page 1241 

(B) If additional manipulation or compounding is required by the receiving pharmacy, receipt of a prescription or order is required and the receiving pharmacy must dispense the product as their own prescription/order. All prescription requirements, record keeping, compounding, and labeling requirements must be met. 
(C) The receiving pharmacy must maintain documentation of the medication received, the name and address of the pharmacy providing the medication, the date of receipt, and the patient’s name. 
(D) The receiving pharmacy is responsible for ensuring compli- ance with all applicable patient counseling requirements. 
(E) For purposes of this rule, administration is defined as applying or introducing medication to the body of a patient, whether by injection, infusion, inhalation, ingestion, or other means. 
(F) Medication administered by a pharmacist must be per- formed in compliance with all applicable provisions of law. 
(G) Notwithstanding any other provision of this rule, licensees shall comply with all applicable controlled substance laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, all applicable security and record keeping requirements. 
(3) A pharmacy participating in Class-J shared services with a pharmacy that is not under common ownership must notify patients that his/her prescription or medication order may be filled or compounded by another pharmacy. 
(4) All records required by this rule including all policy and pro- cedure manuals, contracts, quality assurance documentation, or other agreements must be maintained for two (2) years and must be made available to the board or its representative upon request. 
AUTHORITY: sections 338.140, 338.210, 338.220, 338.240, and 338.280, [RSMo 2000 and 338.210 and 338.220, RSMo Supp. 2001] RSMo 2016. This rule originally filed as 4 CSR 220- 2.650. Original rule filed Nov. 30, 2001, effective June 30, 2002. Amended: Filed Dec. 3, 2002, effective June 30, 2003. Moved to 20 CSR 2220-2.650, effective Aug. 28, 2006. Emergency amendment filed July 27, 2017, effective Aug. 6, 2017, expires Feb. 22, 2018. Amended: Filed July 27, 2017. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed amendment will cost state agencies or political subdivisions approximately one thousand dollars ($1,000) annually for the life of the rule. It is anticipated that the costs will recur for the life of the rule, may vary with inflation, and are expect- ed to increase at the rate projected by the Legislative Oversight Committee. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed amendment will save private entities approximately one thousand dollars ($1,000) annually for the life of the rule. It is anticipated that the costs will recur for the life of the rule, may vary with inflation, and are expected to increase at the rate projected by the Legislative Oversight Committee.

Title 4—DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Division 240—Public Service Commission Chapter 20—Electric Utilities 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Public Service Commission under sec- tions 393.1075.11 and 393.1075.15, RSMo 2016, the commission adopts a rule as follows: 
4 CSR 240-20.092 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on February 1, 2017 (42 MoReg 160–162). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended April 27, 2017, and the commission held a public hearing on the pro- posed rule on May 4, 2017. The commission received timely written comments from the Office of the Public Counsel; Union Electric Company, d/b/a Ameren Missouri; Kansas City Power & Light Company (KCP&L) and KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company (GMO); Renew Missouri; the Missouri Department of Economic Development - Division of Energy; the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC); Walmart Stores, Inc.; the National Housing Trust; the Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance; and the staff of the commission. In addition, the following people offered com- ments at the hearing: Martin Hyman and Barbara Meisenheimer on behalf of the Division of Energy; Andrew Linhares on behalf of Renew Missouri; Phil Fracica on behalf of Energy Efficiency for All; David Woodsmall on behalf of Walmart; Tim Opitz and Geoff Marke on behalf of the Public Counsel; Lewis Mills on behalf of the Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers (MIEC); Jim Fischer and Tim Nelson on behalf of KCP&L and GMO; Paula Johnson and Bill Davis on behalf of Ameren Missouri; and Natelle Dietrich, John Rogers, Robert Berlin, and Brad Fortson on behalf of staff. Many comments and suggested changes were offered. The commission will address those comments as they pertain to the various provisions of the rule. 
COMMENT #1: Staff recommends the commission delete, as extra- neous, one (1) instance of “demand-side” from the definition of “approved demand-side program” found in subsection (1)(B). RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff is correct. The words are extraneous and will be removed from the definition. 
COMMENT #2: Subsection (1)(C) defines the term “avoided cost or avoided utility cost.” Staff proposes that the definition be clarified by specifying that the utility use the integrated resource plan and risk analysis used in its most recently adopted preferred resource plan to 
calculate its avoided costs. DE proposes that the definition specify additional categories of potential avoided costs, and would remove the linking reference to the utility’s integrated resource plan. KCP&L and GMO urge the commission to clarify the last sentence of the def- inition to require the utility to use the preferred resource plan that was in effect at the time of its application to calculate the avoided costs. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff’s proposed changes help to clarify the definition and will be adopted. The clar- ification proposed by KCP&L and GMO to use the preferred refer- ence plan in effect at the time the application is filed could result in the use of very old data in subsequent years. That change will not be adopted. Division of Energy’s listing of additional categories of potential avoided costs is not necessary and will not be adopted. Finally, Division of Energy’s opposition to the rule’s reference to the integrated resource plan is misguided. The commission believes that reference to the integrated resource plan is necessary to provide a benchmark for comparison. 
COMMENT #3: Subsection (1)(D) defines the term “baseline demand forecast.” Staff proposes to clarify the wording of that definition. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change pro- posed by staff clarifies the meaning of the definition and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #4: Subsection (1)(E) defines the term “baseline energy forecast.” Staff proposes to clarify the wording of that definition. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change pro- posed by staff clarifies the meaning of the definition and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #5: Ameren Missouri asks the commission to add a new subsection to define the term “combined heat and power” because it is used in proposed rule 4 CSR 240-20.094 and is becoming an important technology. 
RESPONSE: The additional definition proposed by Ameren Missouri is unnecessary and will not be incorporated into the rule. While com- bined heat and power is a useful tool, it does not always decrease the customer’s total electric consumption and thus may not always be a MEEIA-eligible measure. The fact that it is not defined in this rule does not, however, preclude the inclusion of a combined heat and power measure as a MEEIA measure if it is shown to be appropriate to do so. 
COMMENT #6: Subsection (1)(I) defines the term “deemed sav- ings.” Staff advises the commission to modify the definition to refer to both a utility-specific technical reference manual and to a statewide technical reference manual. Similarly, the Division of Energy would add a reference to a statewide technical reference man- ual. Public Counsel would add the word “estimated” to clarify that deemed savings are estimated engineering savings, not realized sav- ings. Public Counsel would also delete the last two (2) sentences of the proposed definition as unnecessary. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff’s proposed modification to include the use of either an approved technical resource manual, or a statewide technical reference manual is appro- priate and will be adopted. The change proposed by staff incorpo- rates the change proposed by the Division of Energy. Public Counsel’s proposal to add “estimated” to the definition is also an appropriate clarification of the definition and will be adopted. The commission disagrees with Public Counsel’s assessment of the last two (2) sentences of the proposed definition. They do add value to the definition and will be retained in the rule. 
COMMENT #7: Subsection (1)(M) defines “demand-side program.” The term “demand-side program” is defined by statute at section 393.1075.1(3), RSMo 2016. The proposed definition of that term in the rule expands upon the statutory definition by adding a reference to 

Page 1246 
September 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 17 

Orders of Rulemaking 

combined heat and power and distributed generation as types of pro- grams that might qualify as a “demand-side program.” Staff advises the commission to remove combined heat and power and distributed generation from the definition because they do not necessarily mod- ify the net consumption of electricity on the retail customer’s side of the electric meter, and therefore, do not meet the statutory definition. The Division of Energy and Renew Missouri urge the commission to retain combined heat and power and distributed generation in the def- inition, and the Division of Energy would add “conservation voltage reduction” as an example of an eligible demand-side measure. Public Counsel would retain “combined heat and power” but not “distrib- uted generation.” It would also add language indicating that demand- side program does not include “deprivation of service” or “low- income weatherization.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff is correct, combined heat and power and distributed generation should be removed from this definition. While combined heat and power and distributed generation may qualify for a demand-side program under some circumstances, they should not be included in a definition of “demand-side program” as if they would always qualify. Division of Energy’s proposal to add an additional example of a qualifying pro- gram will not be adopted because it is not necessary to include a comprehensive list of qualifying programs in this definition. Public Counsel’s proposal to exclude deprivation of service and low-income weatherization from the definition is appropriate and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #8: Subsection (1)(N) defines “demand-side programs investment mechanism” (DSIM). Staff and Public Counsel propose minor modifications to clarify the wording of this definition. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the changes proposed by staff and Public Counsel, except Public Counsel’s proposal to delete “of a DSIM” from the description of the various components and “recovery” from “pro- gram cost recovery component” as those phrases are a part of the definition of each component. 
COMMENT #9: Subsection (1)(O) defines “demand savings target.” Staff advises the commission to modify the definition to explicitly ref- erence the demand savings level approved by the commission under Rule 4 CSR 240-20.094, the commission’s rule regarding demand- side programs. Public Counsel does not address staff’s proposed change, but advises the commission to remove the word “annual” from the definition because savings targets are determined through a three- (3-) year MEEIA cycle rather than annually. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The comments and changes offered by staff and Public Counsel are reasonable: the additional specificity proposed by staff will be helpful as savings tar- get are not determined on an annual basis. The commission will adopt the proposed changes. 
COMMENT #10: Subsection (1)(P) defines “DSIM amount.” Public Counsel advises the commission to add the word “program” to cost recovery amount. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Public Counsel’s proposed change will clarify the definition and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #11: Ameren Missouri urges the commission to add a definition of “distributed generation” as a new subsection. RESPONSE: The additional definition proposed by Ameren Missouri is unnecessary and will not be incorporated into the rule. While dis- tributed generation is a useful tool, it does not always decrease the cus- tomer’s total electric consumption and thus may not always be a MEEIA-eligible measure. The fact that it is not defined in this rule does not, however, preclude the inclusion of a distributed generation 
measure as a MEEIA measure if it is shown to be appropriate to do so. 
COMMENT #12: Subsection (1)(R) defines “earnings opportunity amount.” Staff advises the commission to insert “case” into the def- inition to be consistent with a later usage within that definition. Public Counsel advises modification of the last part of the definition to require the earnings opportunity to be consistent with “specific future supply-side investment deferral” rather than with an “amount based on the approved earnings opportunity component of a DSIM.” RESPONSE: Staff’s insertion of “case” into the definition is unnec- essary and inconsistent with the rest of the sentence. That modifica- tion will not be made. Public Counsel’s only explanation of its pro- posed change is “adjusted for clarity and statute.” It appears the modification proposed by Public Counsel is intended to reach the same result as the currently proposed language, but without an expla- nation of why the alternative language improves the definition, the commission will not make the proposed modification. 
COMMENT #13: Subsection (1)(S) defines “earnings opportunity component” of a DSM. Ameren Missouri and KCP&L and GMO ask the commission to delete the last sentence of this definition because it limits the commission to implementing that component on a retrospective basis after savings are verified through the EM&V process. Ameren Missouri and KCP&L would prefer the commission leave open the possibility of using the deemed savings values estab- lished in the state-wide TRM. 
RESPONSE: The commission firmly believes that the use of the EM&V process to verify and document energy and demand savings is essential. The commission will not delete the last sentence of the definition. 
COMMENT #14: Subsection (1)(T) defines “economic potential.” The Division of Energy asks the commission to delete its proposed definition and to substitute the definition used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in its “Guide for Conducting Energy Efficiency Potential Studies.” 
RESPONSE: The commission believes the definition it has proposed is most appropriate for use in the context of these Missouri rules. The commission will not adopt the definition proposed by the Division of Energy. 
COMMENT #15: Subsection (1)(W) defines “energy efficiency.” Public Counsel asks the commission to change that definition to rec- ognize that an energy efficiency measure may result in a better end- use. The NRDC asks the commission to modify the definition to rec- ognize that an energy efficiency measure may reduce the use of fuels other than electricity. 
RESPONSE: Public Counsel’s proposed revision is not intended to change the meaning of the definition, but it does create potential con- fusion about what is meant by a “better” given end-use. The com- mission will not adopt the change proposed by Public Counsel. The NRDC’s proposed change would also confuse the meaning of the definition by introducing issues about other fuel sources into a defi- nition applicable only to electric utilities. The commission will not adopt the change proposed by the NRDC. 
COMMENT #16: Subsection (1)(X) defines “energy savings target.” Staff advises the commission to modify the definition to explicitly reference the demand savings level approved by the commission under the commission’s rules regarding demand-side programs, 4 CSR 240-20.094. Public Counsel does not address staff’s proposed change, but advises the commission to remove the word “annual” from the definition because savings targets are determined through a three- (3-) year MEEIA cycle rather than annually. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The comments and changes offered by staff and Public Counsel are reasonable: the additional specificity proposed by staff will be helpful and savings target are not determined on an annual basis. The commission will adopt the proposed changes.

COMMENT #17: Subsection (1)(Y) defines “evaluation, measure- ment, and verification” (EM&V). The Division of Energy asks the commission to add a sentence to require EM&V studies to use a commission-approved statewide TRM. KCP&L and GMO urge the commission to delete “benefits” from the definition because EM&V studies do not calculate the benefits associated with demand-side pro- grams; that is done by the utilities using the EM&V results. Ameren Missouri offers two (2) comments on this definition. First, it would remove “actual” from the definition in recognition that the result of any EM&V study is an estimate rather than a determination of “actu- al” numbers. Second, it would modify the final sentence of the defi- nition to recognize that an EM&V study will report on benefits, cost- effectiveness, and other effects from demand-side programs based on its estimate or verification of energy and demand savings. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The Commission will not amend the definition to mandate use of the statewide TRM as proposed by the Division of Energy. Ameren Missouri’s revised defi- nition is an improvement that does a better job of defining the term EM&V, and will be adopted. The use of the revised definition also eliminates the concerns about calculation of benefits expressed by KCP&L and GMO. 
COMMENT #18: Subsection (1)(Z) defines “filing for demand-side program approval.” Staff advises the commission to substitute “establishment” for “approval” in the definition. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff’s proposed modification is appropriate and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #19: Subsection (1)(BB) defines “interruptible or curtail- able rate.” Public Counsel asks the commission to specify that such rates are “tariff” rates that serve a commission-approved rate class to distinguish them from rates that might be offered as part of a MEEIA activity. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Public Counsel’s proposed modification is appropriate and will be adopted, except that the correct term is “tariffed” rates rather than “tariff” rates. 
COMMENT #20: Public Counsel would add a definition of “load control” to define activities that place the operation of electricity- consuming equipment under the control of an electricity provider or system operator to produce energy or savings demand. RESPONSE: Load control is an interesting concept, but the term is not used in the commission’s regulations, so it does not need to be defined in this rule. 
COMMENT #21: Public Counsel would add a definition of “load management” to describe the use of “load control” activities. RESPONSE: Load management is an interesting concept, but the term is not used in the commission’s regulations, so it does not need to be defined in this rule. 
COMMENT #22: Subsection (1)(CC) defines “market potential study.” Staff advises the commission to substitute “demand-side” for “energy-efficiency” in the definition. The Division of Energy supports the definition’s clarification that market potential studies should be used to guide decision making rather than limiting program planning. Public Counsel would make two changes. First, Public Counsel would add rate design to the list of items that might be considered as the result of a market potential study. Second Public Counsel proposes to add a sentence explaining that a market potential study is to be used primarily to inform a utilities integrated resource planning, and secon- darily, to inform its MEEIA application. Public Counsel explains that this addition is needed to emphasize that the utility should primarily recover the costs of performing its market potential study through a rate case as a general cost of doing business rather than as a special cost to be recovered through a MEEIA-related DSIM. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff’s substitu- tion of the broader “demand-side” for the narrower “energy-efficien- 
cy” in the definition is appropriate and will be adopted. Public Counsel’s addition of “rate design” is appropriate and will be adopt- ed. However, Public Counsel’s addition of a sentence regarding the recovery of the cost of a market potential study is not properly a part of the definition and will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #23: Subsection (1)(DD) defines “market transforma- tion.” Staff would substitute “demand-side savings” for “energy effi- ciency” in the definition. The Division of Energy suggests the defi- nition be deleted because the concept of market transformation is very difficult to describe, and defining it may limit how programs accomplish energy efficiency goals. Public Counsel also would delete the definition as unnecessary, as all MEEIA programs are meant to be market transformation programs. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff’s substitu- tion of the broader “demand-side savings” for the narrower “energy- efficiency” in the definition is appropriate and will be adopted. The term “market transformation” is used in the commission’s MEEIA regulations and is appropriately defined. The suggestion to delete the definition offered by Public Counsel and the Division of Energy will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #24: Subsection (1)(EE) defines “maximum achievable potential.” The NRDC and Renew Missouri ask the commission to revise that definition to remove the idea that a maximum achievable potential study should represent a hypothetical maximum of achiev- able demand-side savings that can only be achieved under ideal con- ditions. Instead, they believe the maximum achievable potential should be defined as a best estimate of the maximum target for all cost-effective demand-side savings a utility can expect to achieve. They argue that is the standard established in the MEEIA statute and should be included in the rule. The Division of Energy is also dissat- isfied with the proposed definition and would instead utilize the def- inition used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. RESPONSE: The commission believes the definition it has proposed is most appropriate for use in the context of these Missouri rules. The commission will not adopt the definition proposed by the NRDC, Renew Missouri, or the Division of Energy. 
COMMENT #25: Subsection (1)(FF) defines “measure.” Staff rec- ommends that “energy” in paragraph (1)(FF)1. of that subsection be replaced by “electricity.” Staff would also add words to that para- graph to clarify the purpose of that provision. Further, staff would alter paragraph (1)(FF)2. of that subsection to clarify that a measure is to decrease peak demand or shift demand to off-peak periods. Public Counsel would remove “behavioral response mechanism” from the definition, and would replace “adequate level and quality” of energy service with “the same or better levels” of energy service. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The changes proposed by staff help to clarify the definition and will be adopted. Public Counsel’s proposal to replace adequate level and quality of service with same or better levels of service also helps to clarify the provision and will be adopted. Public Counsel does not explain why “behavioral response mechanism” should be removed from the defi- nition and the commission will not do so. 
COMMENT #26: Subsection (1)(HH) defines “net shared benefits.” Staff recommends multiple changes to the subsection, beginning with changing the term to be defined to “net benefits.” Further, staff would add a reference to statewide TRM and TRM to acknowledge that utilities might choose to use their own TRM rather than the statewide TRM. The Division of Energy would change the reference to a “technical resource manual” to a “technical reference manual.” KCP&L and GMO recommend a completely revised definition of the term. Public Counsel and Ameren Missouri assert that “net shared benefits” is not used in the new rule and for that reason should not be defined. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commission 

Page 1248 
September 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 17 

Orders of Rulemaking 

believes the proposed definition, as revised by staff is appropriate. The changes proposed by staff will be adopted. 
COMMENT #27: Subsection (1)(II) and paragraphs 1.–4. define “non-energy benefits.” Non-energy benefits represent the concept that increasing energy efficiency has additional benefits for society in general that are not directly related to energy consumption. For example, a decrease in the burning of coal to produce electricity may result in better health for people living downwind of the smoke stack. The National Housing Trust, Renew Missouri, and the Division of Energy strongly support the inclusion of non-energy benefits in the calculation of cost-effectiveness testing, including the total resource cost test (TRC), which is a preferred test in MEEIA matters. They point out that inclusion of non-energy benefits in the definition does not mean that the commission must approve their use in a particular case. Instead, their possible use in an appropriate case would be made possible. Public Counsel contends the entire subsection should be deleted. According to Public Counsel, the quantification of non- energy benefits is subjective and will result in greater uncertainty and risk for the utility and for non-participating ratepayers. Staff would not eliminate the concept of “non-energy benefits” entirely, but would restrict their use to the “societal cost test” and require that they have a quantifiable economic value. KCP&L and GMO agree that non-energy benefits should not be included in the TRC. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion believes that non-energy benefits may be appropriately consid- ered in the TRC, but only if they are quantifiable and result in avoid- ed electric utility costs. An example mentioned at the hearing would be a reduction in the utility’s bad debt expenses resulting from an efficiency measure. The commission will modify the definition accordingly. 
COMMENT #28: Paragraph (1)(II)4., within the definition of “non- energy benefits,” allows for the inclusion of such benefits within cost-effectiveness test “unless they cannot be calculated with a rea- sonable degree of confidence.” Division of Energy would require the inclusion of such non-energy benefits unless they are shown to be non-calculable. KCP&L and GMO would limit the use of non-energy benefits to the “societal cost test.” Ameren Missouri would reverse the presumption by allowing non-energy benefits to be included in cost-effectiveness tests only if they are shown to be calculable. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion has modified this paragraph in response to comment #27. The presumption has been reversed to allow such benefits to be included in cost-effectiveness tests only if they are shown to be calculable. 
COMMENT #29: Subsection (1)(JJ) defines the “non-participant” test, also known as the “ratepayer impact measure” (RIM). Staff advises the commission to make “avoided cost” plural, and to add a clause recognizing the costs of statewide TRM and TRM as utility costs to be considered in the test. KCP&L and Public Counsel sug- gest the test be recognized at the ratepayer impact measure (RIM), since that it is how it is referred to by most experts. Public Counsel would also recognize the utility’s lost earnings opportunity resulting from the implementation of demand-side programs. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees that this test is more properly described as “ratepayer impact measure (RIM).” The other modifications proposed by staff and Public Counsel are appropriate and will be adopted. Since these definitions are arranged in alphabetical order, this subsection, and the following subsections, will be renumbered accordingly. 
COMMENT #30: Subsection (1)(KK) defines “participant test.” Public Counsel comments that the proper term to be defined is “par- ticipant costs test (PCT).” RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Public Counsel is correct. The commission will adopt that change. 
COMMENT #31: Subsection (1)(LL) defines “preferred resource plan” as the utility’s resource plan adopted in accordance with the commission’s integrated resource plan (IRP) rules. The Division of Energy urges the commission to delete this definition because it opposes any connection between these MEEIA rules and the IRP process. 
RESPONSE: The commission believes the reference and linkage to the integrated resource plan is necessary to provide a benchmark for comparison. The commission will not delete the definition. 
COMMENT #32: Subsection (1)(MM) defines “probable environ- mental compliance costs.” Staff proposes several modifications to this definition. First, it would make cost plural. Second, it would eliminate a list of environmental regulations to be considered and would replace it with a direction to the utility to consider the envi- ronmental considerations included in its current preferred resource plan under the IRP rules. Public Counsel also suggests that the list of environmental regulations be deleted. KCP&L and GMO, as well as Ameren Missouri, ask the commission to revise this definition to mirror the definition of probable environmental cost established in the commission’s IRP rules at 4 CSR 240-22.020(47). 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff’s pro- posed changes are appropriate and bring the definition in line with the parallel definition in the IRP rules. The commission will adopt the changes proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #33: Subsection (1)(OO) defines “realistic achievable potential.” The NRDC and Renew Missouri urge the commission to entirely delete this definition and any reference to “realistic achiev- able potential” in these rules. They argue that “maximum achievable potential” is the equivalent of the MEEIA statute’s stated goal of achieving maximum cost-effective efficiency savings, and, as a result, “realistic achievable potential” simply allows for achieving less than “maximum achievable potential.” The Division of Energy is also dissatisfied with this definition and would instead use the def- inition used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. RESPONSE: The commission believes the definition it has proposed is most appropriate for use in the context of these Missouri rules. The commission will not adopt the changes proposed by the NRDC, Renew Missouri, or the Division of Energy. 
COMMENT #34: Subsection (1)(PP) defines “societal cost test.” Staff would explicitly add non-energy benefits to the externalities that may be considered as part of the societal cost test. KCP&L and GMO note that the word “externalities” is not defined in the proposed rules. Ameren Missouri proposes a revised definition described as the total resource cost test plus non-energy benefits. Public Counsel also suggests alternate wording for the definition. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Ameren Missouri’s simplified definition accomplishes the definition of soci- etal cost test as including non-energy benefits in the same way as pro- posed by staff and Public Counsel, but does so more clearly. The commission will adopt the change proposed by Ameren Missouri. 
COMMENT #35: Ameren Missouri proposes a new definition of “stakeholder.” Its intent is to limit participants in the collaborative process that occurs during an active MEEIA cycle. Ameren Missouri would limit such stakeholder to the parties to the case in which the commission approved the utility’s demand side portfolio, and then only if such party affirmatively indicated a desire to contin- ue as a stakeholder during the collaborative process. 
RESPONSE: The commission does not believe that the term stake- holder needs to be defined within the rule. Certainly, participation in the collaborative process does not need to be as narrowly constrained as Ameren Missouri suggests. The definition proposed by Ameren Missouri will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #36: Subsection (1)(RR) defines “statewide technical 
 
September 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 17 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 1249 

reference manual or statewide TRM.” Staff proposes the definition be modified to indicate the statewide TRM will be developed by the utilities and stakeholders rather than by a statewide collaborative. Staff would also remove the language describing the commission’s approval of the statewide TRM. The Division of Energy proposes a revised definition that explicitly references provisions of other com- mission regulations. Public Counsel suggests the definition be delet- ed as redundant to the definition of “technical resource manual.” Ameren Missouri also suggests this subsection be deleted and the definition incorporated into the definition of technical resource man- ual. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Public Counsel and Ameren Missouri are correct. The definition of statewide tech- nical reference manual is best incorporated into the definition of technical reference manual, which is subsection (1)(TT) in the pro- posed rule (subsection (1)(RR) in the final rule). The remaining sub- sections are renumbered. 
COMMENT #37: Subsection (1)(SS) defines “technical potential.” The Division of Energy proposes that this definition be replaced with the definition used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. RESPONSE: The commission believes the definition it has proposed is most appropriate for use in the context of these Missouri rules. The commission will not adopt the changes proposed by the Division of Energy. 
COMMENT #38: Subsection (1)(TT) defines “technical resource manual.” The Division of Energy proposes to delete the entire defi- nition. Public Counsel and Ameren Missouri offer revised defini- tions. Public Counsel would add a reference to “estimated” energy and demand savings, and would delete a reference to “demand response” programs. Public Counsel explains that demand response programs will be time and place specific and do not lend themselves to the purpose of the TRM. Ameren Missouri would offer a simpli- fied definition that also refers to the statewide TRM. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion believes Ameren Missouri’s simplified definition best describes a TRM and also incorporates the use of a statewide TRM. The com- mission will adopt the change proposed by Ameren Missouri except that the clause in the proposed rule that describes programs “within an electric utility’s service territory” will be retained. 
COMMENT #39: Subsection (1)(XX) defines “total resource cost test or TRC.” Staff, NRDC, Division of Energy, KCP&L and GMO, Ameren Missouri, and Public Counsel all propose that this definition be extensively revised. Staff, KCP&L and GMO, Ameren Missouri, and Public Counsel propose definitions that would not allow for con- sideration of non-energy benefits in the TRC. The NRDC and the Division of Energy propose definitions that would allow considera- tion of non-energy benefits in the TRC. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: As was dis- cussed in Comment #26, related to the definition of non-energy ben- efits, the commission will allow the consideration of non-energy ben- efits in the TRC, but only if they are quantifiable and result in avoid- ed electric utility costs. However, non-energy benefits do not need to be again specifically included in the definition of total resource cost test. The revised definition proposed by staff is a simplification of the proposed definition and best describes the term as it is used in these rules. The commission will adopt the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #40: Subsection (1)(YY) defines “utility cost test.” Ameren Missouri proposes a simplified version of that definition that recognizes that “avoided utility cost” and “cost recovery amount” are defined elsewhere in the rule. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion notes that the only difference between the total resource cost test and the utility cost test is that the total cost test includes participant costs, while the utility cost does not. Therefore, the definition for 
utility cost test will be the same as for total resource cost test except that participant costs will be excluded from the definition of utility cost test. 
COMMENT # 41: Ameren Missouri suggests that this rule should have a provision allowing the commission to grant a variance from any provision of the rule for good cause. Staff agrees with that sug- gestion. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will add a new section (2) to allow for the granting of a variance for good cause shown. 
4 CSR 240-20.092 Definitions for Demand-Side Programs and Demand-Side Programs Investment Mechanisms

amount; (X) Energy savings target means the energy savings level approved 
by the commission under 4 CSR 240-20.094(4)(I) or 4 CSR 240- 20.094(5)(A)6. Energy savings targets are the baseline for determin- ing the utility’s demand-side portfolio’s energy savings performance levels for the earnings opportunity component of a DSIM; 
(Y) Evaluation, measurement, and verification, or EM&V, means the performance of studies and activities intended to evaluate the process of the utility’s program delivery and oversight and to esti- mate and/or verify the estimated annual energy and demand savings, and to report on the benefits, cost effectiveness, and other effects from demand-side programs, based on those estimated and/or veri- fied energy and demand savings; 
(Z) Filing for demand-side programs approval means a utility’s filing for establishment, modification, or discontinuance of demand- side program(s) which may also include a simultaneous request for the establishment, modification, or discontinuance of a DSIM; 
(BB) Interruptible or curtailable rate means a tariffed rate under which a customer receives a reduced charge in exchange for agreeing to allow the utility to withdraw the supply of electricity under certain specified conditions; 
(CC) Market potential study means a quantitative analysis of the amount of energy and demand savings that may exist, is cost-effec- tive, and could be realized through the implementation of demand- side programs, policies, and rate design;

(MM Program pilot means a demand-side program designed to operate on a limited basis for evaluation purposes before full imple- mentation; 
(NN) Ratepayer impact measure (RIM) test is a measure of the dif- ference between the change in total revenues paid to a utility and the change in total cost incurred by the utility as a result of the imple- mentation of demand-side programs. The benefits are the avoided costs as a result of implementation. The costs consist of incentives paid to participants, other costs incurred by the utility, and the loss in revenue as a result of diminished consumption, and the utility’s earnings opportunity as a result of implementation of demand-side programs. Utility costs include the costs to administer, deliver, and evaluate each demand-side program and the costs of statewide TRM or TRM and statewide TRM;

Title 4—DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Division 240—Public Service Commission Chapter 20—Electric Utilities 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Public Service Commission under sec- tions 393.1075.11 and 393.1075.15, RSMo 2016, the commission amends a rule as follows: 
4 CSR 240-20.093 is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on February 1, 2017 (42 MoReg 162–168). Those sections with changes are reprint- ed here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended April 27, 2017, and the commission held a public hearing on the pro- posed amendment on May 4, 2017. The commission received timely written comments from the Office of the Public Counsel; Union Electric Company, d/b/a Ameren Missouri; Kansas City Power & Light Company (KCP&L) and KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company (GMO); Renew Missouri; the Missouri Department of Economic Development - Division of Energy; the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC); Walmart Stores, Inc.; the National Housing Trust; the Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance; and the staff of the commission. In addition, the following people offered com- ments at the hearing: Martin Hyman and Barbara Meisenheimer on behalf of the Division of Energy; Andrew Linhares on behalf of Renew Missouri; Phil Fracica on behalf of Energy Efficiency for All; David Woodsmall on behalf of Walmart; Tim Opitz and Geoff Marke on behalf of the Public Counsel; Lewis Mills on behalf of the Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers (MIEC); Jim Fischer and Tim Nelson on behalf of KCP&L and GMO; Paula Johnson and Bill Davis on behalf of Ameren Missouri; and Natelle Dietrich, John Rogers, Robert Berlin, and Brad Fortson on behalf of staff. Many comments and suggested changes were offered. The commission will address those comments as they pertain to the various provisions of the rule. 
COMMENT #1: Staff recommends Demand-Side Program in section (1) be made plural to match the wording of 4 CSR 240-20.092. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff is correct and the change will be adopted. The same change will be made in section (2). 
COMMENT #2: Staff recommends adding words to strengthen the requirement in subsection (2)(A) that supporting worksheets be sub- mitted with models and spreadsheets intact. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff’s proposal is reasonable and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #3: Paragraph (2)(A)3. describes the items that a utility must file as part of its application for approval of a Demand-Side Programs Investment Mechanism (DSIM). Ameren Missouri sug- gests the requirement to submit a “complete” description of workings of the proposed DSIM be replaced with a “reasonably detailed” description, contending that, in a literal sense, a “complete” descrip- tion can never be attained. Ameren Missouri believes “reasonably detailed” is a more realistic requirement. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion understands Ameren Missouri’s concern, but the requirement of a “complete” description should not be weakened to the extent that a utility would be able to hide any aspect of its proposed DSIM. The commission will alter the paragraph to require a “complete, reason- ably detailed” description. 
COMMENT #4: Staff recommends the addition of “net benefits” to paragraph (2)(A)4. to clarify the requirement that a utility must pro- vide an estimate of the effect of its DSIM on customer bills. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff’s proposal is a reasonable clarification of the paragraph’s requirements and it will be adopted. 
COMMENT #5: Paragraph (2)(A)5. requires a utility applying to establish, continue, or modify a DSIM to estimate the effects of the “earnings opportunity” component of the DSIM on earnings and key credit metrics. Ameren Missouri explains that all aspects of the DSIM, not just the “earnings opportunity” component, have an impact on earnings and key credit metrics. It suggests the required explanation be broadened to all components of DSIM by removing the words “earn- ings opportunity component of” from the paragraph. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Ameren Missouri’s proposal is a reasonable modification of the paragraph’s requirements and it will be adopted. 
COMMENT #6: Paragraph (2)(A)6. requires the utility applying to establish, continue, or modify a DSIM to provide a “complete” explanation of all costs to be recovered under the proposed DSIM. As in comment #3, Ameren Missouri would replace “complete” with “reasonably detailed.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: As explained in its response to comment #3, the commission will alter the paragraph to require a “complete, reasonably detailed” description. 
COMMENT #7: Paragraph (2)(A)7. requires a “complete” explana- tion of any change in business risk resulting from implementation of the earnings opportunity component of the DSIM. As in comment #3, Ameren Missouri would replace “complete” with “reasonably detailed.” And, as in comment #5, Ameren Missouri would remove “earnings opportunity component” to broaden the explanation to include the effect of all aspects of the DSIM. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: As explained in its response to comment #3, the commission will alter the paragraph to require a “complete, reasonably detailed” description. And as explained in its response to comment #5, the commission will adopt the change proposed by Ameren Missouri. 
COMMENT #8: Paragraph (2)(A)8. requires a proposal for how the commission can determine whether any earning opportunity compo- nent of a proposed DSIM is aligned with efforts for customer energy efficiency. Staff proposes to broaden the requirement by requiring consideration of the throughput disincentive component of the DSIM along with the earnings opportunity component. As in comment #5, Ameren Missouri would further broaden the requirement by making it apply to all aspects of the DSIM. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: As in comment #5, the commission finds that requiring an explanation about all aspects of the DSIM is appropriate. The commission will adopt the change proposed by Ameren Missouri, which will subsume the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #9: Staff proposes to add “and” to the end of paragraph (2)(A)9. to indicate all paragraphs in the sequence are required. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will make the modification proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #10: Paragraph (2)(A)10. requires a utility proposing to adjust its DSIM amount between general rate proceedings to offer specified explanations. Staff would replace “approved new” with “established” when describing modified or discontinued demand-side programs. As in comment #3, Ameren Missouri would replace “com- plete” with “reasonably detailed.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commission will adopt the change proposed by staff as an appropriate clarification

Orders of Rulemaking 

of the paragraph. As explained in the responses to comments #3, the commission will add “reasonably detailed” to the “complete” require- ment. 
COMMENT #11: Among other things, subsection (2)(B) requires a utility to provide certain workpapers with all formulas intact. Staff would require that links also be provided intact. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #12: Paragraph (2)(B)3. includes a requirement that the utility seeking to modify its DSIM provide a “complete” explanation of an change in business risk resulting from the modification. As in comments #3 and #5, Ameren Missouri proposes to replace “com- plete” with “reasonably detailed” and delete the limitation to “earn- ings opportunity component” to require explanation of the resulting impact of the modification of the entire DSIM. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: As explained in its responses to comments #3 and #5, the commission will add rea- sonably detailed to the complete requirement, and will delete the lim- iting “earnings opportunity component.” 
COMMENT #13: Subsection (2)(C) provides that any party to the utility’s application for approval of its demand-side program may support or oppose any aspect of that application, or may propose an alternative DSIM for the commission’s consideration. The last sen- tence of the subsection recognizes that the commission has authority to approve or reject any establishment, continuation, or modification of a DSIM. Staff proposes to modify that part of the subsection to emphasize that any new DSIM, or changes to an existing DSIM must be approved by the commission, but must also be acceptable to the utility. Ameren Missouri supports that clarification. The NRDC commented on the same provision of the subsection, advising the commission to emphasize that it has “sole” authority to approve, accept, or reject the establishment, continuation, or modification of a DSIM. Ameren Missouri opposed the change proposed by the NRDC. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The MEEIA statute, section 393.1075, RSMo 2016, provides that an electric util- ity may choose whether to participate in a MEEIA program; it is not required to do so. But, if the utility chooses to participate, the terms of its participation must be approved by the commission. The last sentence of this subsection as published in the proposed amendment, and as it exists in the current rule, inadvertently muddles that princi- ple by implying that both the commission and the utility retain authority to accept or reject a DSIM. Both staff and the NRDC attempt to clarify that the commission has sole authority to approve or reject all aspects of the utility’s MEEIA program, while recogniz- ing that the utility retains the ability to walk away from the program if it is dissatisfied with the commission’s decision. 
That is an interesting principle, but it is not a principle that needs to be addressed in this subsection. The purpose of the subsection is to establish that other parties may support, oppose, or offer alterna- tives to the utility’s proposal. The last sentence strays from that pur- pose by unnecessarily reasserting the commission’s authority to approve or reject the utility’s DSIM. The commission’s authority to approve or reject any new or modified DSIM is established by statute and does not need to be restated in this subsection. The final sentence of this subsection is unnecessary and will be deleted. 
COMMENT #14: Subsection (2)(D) indicates the commission shall approve a DSIM if it finds the electric utility’s demand-side savings programs are expected to result in energy and demand savings, and are expected to benefit all customers, even those that do not partici- pate in the programs. Renew Missouri asks the commission to change the wording of this subsection to emphasize that such programs should be designed to achieve “all cost effective energy and demand savings.” Further, Renew Missouri wants to emphasize that a pro- 
gram may be beneficial for a customer over the long-term, even if it does not immediately reduce that customer’s rates. RESPONSE: The stated goal of the MEEIA statute is to achieve all cost-effective demand-side savings. But that does not mean the com- mission may only approve a MEEIA filing if it results in all cost- effective energy and demand savings as Renew Missouri would write into the rule. It must be remembered that utility participation in MEEIA is voluntary. Renew Missouri’s proposed changes would constrain the commission’s ability to approve an appropriate set of demand-side programs. Renew Missouri’s proposed changes will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #15: Subsection (2)(E) provides that the commission shall consider changes in the utility’s business risk resulting from having a DSIM in setting the utility’s allowed return on equity in a general rate proceeding. Ameren Missouri contends the wording of the subsection should not presume that there are changes in the util- ity’s business risk resulting from the presence of a DSIM. It would add a “if any” clause to the rule to remove any such presumption. RESPONSE: The language of the current rule does not pre-deter- mine or presume that a DSIM has any effect on a utility’s business risk. Rather it says the commission shall consider such changes when setting the utility’s rates. If, as a matter of fact, there are no changes in the utility’s business risk, the commission will so find and there will be no impact on the utility’s rates. The change proposed by Ameren Missouri is unnecessary and will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #16: Staff advises the commission to modify subsection 20.093(2)(F) by adding language to improve the readability of the first sentence of the subsection. The proposed change has no substan- tive effect on the rule. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #17: Subsection (2)(G) describes the costs that may be recovered by a utility through the cost recovery component of a DSIM. The current rule indicates the cost of a utility market potential study may be recovered through the DSIM. Public Counsel contends the utility’s cost to produce a market potential study should not be recov- ered through the DSIM. Rather, because such studies are required for purposes of the integrated resource planning (IRP) process, they should be recovered by the utility through the general ratemaking process where those costs can be shared by all the utility’s customers, including those that have opted-out of MEEIA. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Public Counsel is correct, the cost of producing a market potential study should not be presumed to be recoverable through a DSIM as a MEEIA-related cost. The commission will remove it from the amendment. That does not mean that in a particular case a utility is precluded from showing that the cost of producing a market potential study should be attrib- uted to MEEIA demand-side programs and recovered through its DSIM. But the appropriateness of such recovery will not be pre- sumed. 
COMMENT #18: Subsection (2)(H) concerns the throughput disin- centive component of a DSIM. Staff proposes to modify the subsec- tion to clarify that a throughput disincentive component can be based on energy savings, or energy and demand savings, but not on demand savings alone. The Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance and Renew Missouri propose that the subsection should explicitly require an annual true-up of the throughput disincentive through the EM&V process. KCP&L and GMO propose alternative language designed to recognize the use of a statewide TRM. Ameren Missouri proposes language to explicitly allow for the use of a commission-approved TRM in place of EM&V. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff’s proposed changes clarify the rule and will be adopted. The changes suggested by the Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance and Renew Missouri, as 
 
September 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 17 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 1253 

well as the suggestions offered by Ameren Missouri and KCP&L and GMO, would unnecessarily limit the commission’s discretion in con- sidering a particular proposed DSIM. The commission will not adopt those changes. 
COMMENT #19: Staff recommends that the reference in paragraph (2)(H)1. to Rule 4 CSR 240-20.094, Demand-Side Portfolio be changed to Demand-Side Programs to be consistent with the title of Rule 4 CSR 240-20.094. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff’s proposed change is appropriate and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #20: Subsection (2)(I) concerns the earning opportunity component of a DSIM. Ameren Missouri would modify the language of the subsection to acknowledge that the earnings opportunity com- ponent may be based on the entirety of a DSIM portfolio rather than on individual programs within a portfolio. 
RESPONSE: The commission does not believe the changes proposed by Ameren Missouri are appropriate. The commission must be able to evaluate individual programs to determine the utility’s overall earnings opportunity. That is what the proposed amendment permits. 
COMMENT #21: Staff proposes to clarify paragraph (2)(I)1. by sub- stituting a full regulation citation for the word “section.” RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #22: Ameren Missouri proposes a change in paragraph (2)(I)2. to clarify that the commission is to approve any earnings opportunity component of a DSIM at the same time it approves the utility’s demand-side programs. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Ameren Missouri’s change helps to clarify the requirements of the rule and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #23: Ameren Missouri proposes to delete paragraph (2)(I)3. That paragraph requires that any earnings opportunity com- ponent of a DSIM be implemented retrospectively and all energy and demand savings used to determine a DSIM earnings opportunity amount must be measured and verified through EM&V. Ameren Missouri would delete this provision to allow the commission the ability to use deemed savings described in a TRM to avoid the neces- sity of verification through EM&V, and to allow the commission to determine whether prospective or retrospective implementation is appropriate in the particular circumstances of each case. RESPONSE: The commission believes that verification through EM&V is vitally important to protect ratepayers. The commission will not adopt the change proposed by Ameren Missouri. 
COMMENT #24: Staff proposes minor wording changes to clarify subsection (2)(J). Ameren Missouri also proposes one (1) of the changes proposed by staff. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the changes proposed by Ameren Missouri and staff. 
COMMENT #25: Among other things, subsection (3)(A) requires a utility to provide certain workpapers with all formulas intact. Staff would add that links also be provided intact. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #26: Ameren Missouri proposes changes to paragraphs (3)(A)2.–4. It suggests, as it did in comment #3, that the requirement to submit a “complete” description of workings of the proposed DSIM be replaced with a “reasonably detailed” description, contend- ing that, in a literal sense, a “complete” description can never be attained. Ameren Missouri believes “reasonably detailed” is a more realistic requirement. Ameren Missouri also suggests, as it did in 
COMMENT #5, that paragraph 4. be broadened to apply to the entire DSIM rather than just the earnings opportunity element of the DSIM. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commission understands Ameren Missouri’s concern, but the requirement of a “complete” description should not be weakened to the extent that a utility would be able to hide any aspect of its proposed DSIM. The commission will alter the paragraph to require a “complete, reasonably detailed” description. Ameren Missouri’s proposed modification of paragraph 4. to broaden the requirement to report on the effect of changes in business risk will be adopted. Ameren Missouri’s proposal to add “if any” to the last sentence is unnecessary and will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #27: Ameren Missouri proposes to simplify the lan- guage of section (4), which sets requirements for adjustments for DSIM’s by simply referring to adjustment of the entire DSIM rather than referring to each of its cost recovery, throughput disincentive, and earnings opportunity elements. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Ameren Missouri’s proposal is a simplification of the language of the section that does not change the meaning of the regulation. The purpose of the section is to require that adjustments be made no less than annu- ally. The rest of the section that says that each of the DSIM elements may be adjusted is unnecessary and will be deleted. Additional changes to this section are described in comment #30. 
COMMENT #28: Among other things, subsection (4)(A) requires a utility to provide certain workpapers with all formulas intact. Staff would add that links also be provided intact. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #29: Staff proposes a change to paragraph (4)(A)2. That subsection requires a utility to file information to support its tariff to adjust its DSIM. Paragraph 2. requires the utility to file information supporting its “proposed adjustments or refunds by rate class.” Staff would add the words “positive or negative” to modify proposed adjustments, and would remove the word “refunds” because that is not an accurate description of the adjustment. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff’s proposed modifications are appropriate and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #30: Ameren Missouri recommends changes to subsec- tion (4)(B). This subsection describes the process the commission will use to review a tariff filed by a utility seeking to adjust its DSIM rates. The proposed rule requires the commission to either approve, or reject the tariff filing within sixty (60) days of its filing. Ameren Missouri proposes that language be added to the amendment to allow the commission to either approve the tariff change, or to simply allow it to go into effect by operation of law on the tariff’s effective date if it is not rejected. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion generally prefers to issue a ruling to either approve or reject a DSIM tariff. However, the procedure described by Ameren Missouri is allowed and the commission should have the discretion to follow that procedure if, in some circumstance, it becomes necessary or appropriate. There is no reason to impose an additional requirement on the commission through this regulation. The commission will adopt the changes proposed by Ameren Missouri. 
COMMENT #31: Ameren Missouri suggests subsection (4)(C) be deleted as duplicative of subsection (2)(J). RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Subsection (2)(J) requires a DSIM to include a provision requiring the filing of annual adjustments. Subsection (4)(C) requires an electric utility to file such an adjustment at least once a year. They accomplish the same purpose, but are not duplicative. However, the requirement of 

Page 1254 
September 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 17 

Orders of Rulemaking 

subsection (4)(C) is duplicative of the passively-worded requirement found in section (4). Subsection (4)(C) will be deleted and its words moved to section (4) to replace that passive language. The remaining subsections will be renumbered. 
COMMENT #32: Staff proposes some wording changes to clarify subsection (4)(D). RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The changes proposed by staff clarify the meaning of the subsection without changing its meaning. The commission will adopt those changes. 
COMMENT #33: Staff proposes a wording change to clarify subsec- tion (4)(F). The proposed change will better define when staff, pub- lic counsel, or other party may notify the electric utility that it has not met the filing requirements of this rule. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The changes proposed by staff are appropriate and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #34: Section (5) indicates a utility may request the use of deferral accounting to defer the financial impacts resulting from MEEIA for recovery in a future general rate case. Staff proposes multiple wording changes to clarify the meaning of the section. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The changes proposed by staff are appropriate and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #35: Subsection (5)(A) concerns the duration of an approved DSIM. Ameren Missouri and KCP&L and GMO are con- cerned that while the regulation allows the utility to fully recover all DSIM amounts, it also suggests the commission can modify or dis- continue the DSIM. The utilities are concerned that this would imply that they might not be allowed to fully recover the DSIM amount, creating a financial risk that would discourage implementation of demand-side programs. They also point out that utility compliance with MEEIA is voluntary and contend the approved DSIM cannot be modified without their approval. 
The utilities are also concerned that the last two (2) sentences of the subsection allow parties to the case in which the DSIM was approved to proposed modifications to the DSIM. They contend this contradicts subsection (2)(K), which states that approved earnings opportunity components of DSIMs are binding on the commission and the utility for the entire term of the DSIM unless otherwise ordered or conditioned by the commission when approved. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The concerns expressed by Ameren Missouri and KCP&L and GMO are under- standable. If they are not assured of their ability to recover all DSIM amounts, they will not be willing to implement costly demand-side programs. Similarly, since participation in MEEIA is voluntary, the approved DSIM, to which the utility has given its assent, cannot be changed without the utility’s assent. The commission will modify the language of this subsection to address these concerns. 
The commission also notes that the sentence in this subsection that requires the electric utility to submit proposed tariff sheets to imple- ment interim adjustments to its DSIM rates is merely a restatement of the requirements of subsection (4)(A). As such it will be deleted. 
The commission further notes that subsection (5)(B) is being delet- ed from the rule. That means subsection (5)(A) is now the only sub- section of section (5). Subsection (A) is more properly denominated as its own section, which will be section (6). The remaining sections of the rule will be renumbered accordingly. 
COMMENT #36: Section (7) concerns evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) of demand-side programs. Public Counsel proposes a change to that section to ensure the independence of the independent EM&V contractor engaged by the utility. Public Counsel suggests the same limiting language on staff that the proposed amendment applies to the contract auditor engaged by staff be applied to the utility. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The indepen- 
dent EM&V contractor engaged by the utility should be as indepen- dent as the EM&V contractor engaged by staff. The commission will adopt the change proposed by Public Counsel. 
COMMENT #37: Public Counsel proposes a change in subsection (7)(A), which is a subsection in the existing rule that the commission has not proposed to amend. That subsection limits a utility’s EM&V budget to not more than five percent (5%) of the utility’s total budget for all approved demand-side program costs. Public Counsel argues that percentage should be reduced to two and one half percent (2.5%) if the utility has deployed advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). RESPONSE: Public Counsel contends that when a utility has deployed AMI it will have greater knowledge of realized energy and demand savings and should be able to spend less on EM&V. Public Counsel did not, however, quantify the amount of savings that could be realized. The commission has no way of knowing whether the two and a half percent (2.5%) budget limitation proposed by Public Counsel is reasonable. As AMI technology becomes more prevalent the commission will have a stronger basis to determine whether any budget adjustment is appropriate. The commission will not adopt the change proposed by Public Counsel in this rulemaking. 
COMMENT #38: Among other things, paragraph (7)(D)1. requires a utility to provide certain workpapers with all formulas intact. Staff would add that links also be provided intact. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #39: Subparagraph (7)(D)1.B. requires that a EM&V final report include an impact evaluation of demand and energy sav- ings. The Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance suggests non-energy impacts, such as reduced water consumption, job creation, reduced customer disconnections, etc. should also be included in the EM&V reports. 
RESPONSE: Non-energy impacts may be considered under the soci- etal cost test, which is to be included in the EM&V final report pur- suant to part (7)(D)1.B.(II). There is no need to amend the rule to give such impacts additional consideration. The commission will not adopt the change proposed by the Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance. 
COMMENT #40: Part (7)(D)1.B.(I) provides that the contents of the impact evaluation to be included in an EM&V final report is to include an evaluation of the lifetime and annual gross and net demand savings and energy saving achieved under each demand-side pro- gram. KCP&L and GMO, as well as Ameren Missouri, urge the commission to remove the word “lifetime” from that part as lifetime savings have little value to the EM&V analysis and are not currently calculated by the utility or the EM&V contractor. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with the comment and will adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #41: Part (7)(D)1.B.(III) requires the EM&V report to include a determination of the benefits achieved for each demand- side program and portfolio using the utility cost test (UCT) method- ology. Staff proposes minor changes to make utility cost test lower case, and change “benefits” to “net benefits.” Public Counsel con- tends the TRC, not the UCT is the proper test to be used. KCP&L and GMO argue the entire part should be deleted. The Division of Energy proposes changes that would indicate EM&V reports do not need to contain an estimate of UCT-based benefits for demand-side programs that are not subject to cost-effectiveness testing. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion believes that use of the UCT is appropriate for the purpose of this part. The Division of Energy’s concerns about the estimation of benefits for programs that are not subject to cost-effectiveness testing are well based. The commission will make the changes proposed by the Division of Energy, and will also make the clarifying changes 
 
September 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 17 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 1255 

proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #42: Paragraph (7)(E)1. requires an electric utility’s EM&V contractor to include specific methodology for performing EM&V work. Public Counsel would add a requirement to include net-to-gross components limited solely to free ridership and spillover. Public Counsel believes that doing so will add clarity as to what spe- cific net-to-gross components an EM&V contractor should be allowed to examine. 
RESPONSE: The commission does not believe that its rules should narrowly specify what an EM&V contractor should be allowed to examine. The commission will not adopt the change proposed by Public Counsel. 
COMMENT #43: Paragraph (7)(E)2. would require EM&V contrac- tors to utilize the most current statewide TRM when that document has been approved by the commission. Staff would change that para- graph to allow the utility to use either its own approved TRM or the statewide TRM. Ameren Missouri proposes slightly different lan- guage to accomplish the same change recommended by staff. Public Counsel suggests the entire paragraph be deleted to avoid the use of deemed savings values. KCP&L would modify the paragraph to clar- ify that the statewide TRM to be used is the one in effect at the time the utility files its application. The Division of Energy would modify the paragraph to clarify that the EM&V evaluation would be based on the methodologies contained within the utility’s application rather than on subsequently changed methodologies. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commission agrees with staff and Ameren Missouri. The use of a utility-specific TRM should be permitted if the commission finds that to be appropri- ate. The language proposed by Ameren Missouri is simpler and will be adopted. The other proposed changes will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #44: The Division of Energy would add a new para- graph (7)(E)3., which would create a rebuttable presumption that measured savings determined by application of the state-wide TRM are accurate. According to the Division of Energy, this change is intended to make the state-wide TRM the default tool for measure evaluation by utility EM&V contractors. 
RESPONSE: As previously indicated, the commission intends to allow for the use of alternative TRMs and will not make the change proposed by the Division of Energy. 
COMMENT #45: Section (8) describes the content and procedures surrounding the demand-side program annual report to be filed by the electric utilities. The section allows interested parties ninety (90) days from the day the report is filed to file comments about that report. Staff proposes that the comment period be shortened to thirty (30) days. Renew Missouri suggests the rule require the electric utilities to make a public version of their report available for publication on the commission’s website. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion believes that a shorter time allowed for filing comments will allow the commission to consider those comments more quickly and should not impose a burden on those wishing to file comments. The commission will adopt the change proposed by staff. Renew Missouri’s proposal is also reasonable and will ensure that the demand-side program annual reports are readily available to the pub- lic. The commission will adopt the change proposed by Renew Missouri. 
COMMENT #46: Subsection (8)(B) describes the contents of a util- ity’s demand-side program annual report. Paragraph 3. of that sub- section requires the report to include a comparison of certain savings impacts. Staff would modify the description of the savings impacts to be compared. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff’s proposed change will clarify the requirement and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #47: Public Counsel asks the commission to delete paragraph (8)(B)4., which provides that for market transformation demand-side programs, the demand-side program annual report must include a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the progress being made in transforming the market. Public Counsel believes that all MEEIA programs should be considered market transforming and that the requirement is unnecessary and redundant. 
RESPONSE: The commission disagrees with Public Counsel and believes the reporting requirement will be useful. The commission will not make the change proposed by Public Counsel. 
COMMENT #48: Paragraph (8)(B)8. requires the demand-side pro- gram annual report to include the estimated net economic benefits and net-shared benefits of the demand-side portfolio. Staff would delete “economic benefits” and “shared” from “net shared benefits” in recognition that “net economic benefits” and “net shared benefits” are not defined terms used in the rules. Ameren Missouri and KCP&L and GMO would make changes to accomplish the same pur- pose as staff, and would add a reference to the utility cost test (UCT). Public Counsel would delete the entire paragraph as unnecessary and subjective. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion believes that the paragraph, as modified by staff, will add valu- able information to the demand-side program annual report. The commission will adopt the changes proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #49: Paragraph (8)(B)11. requires the demand-side pro- gram annual report to include a demonstration of the relationship of the demand-side program to demand-side resources in the latest filed IRP compliance filing. Staff would make demand-side program plural. The NRDC and the Division of Energy would delete the entire para- graph because of their opposition to any linkage between the MEEIA program and the IRP requirements. Public Counsel would delete the entire paragraph as unnecessary and unclear. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion believes the connection between MEEIA and the IRP require- ments is important to establishing a baseline to measure the effective- ness of the MEEIA programs. The commission will retain the para- graph, but will make the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #50: Among other things, section (9) requires a utility to provide certain workpapers with all formulas intact. Staff would add that links also be provided intact. The section requires electric utilities with an approved DSIM to submit a Surveillance Monitoring Report, including a quarterly progress report. Ameren Missouri sug- gests a change to allow the utility to offer suggestions on the format of the quarterly progress report. It would also provide for the report to be submitted to other stakeholders. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the change proposed by staff. Ameren Missouri’s pro- posal to recognize format suggestions from the utilities is reasonable and will be adopted, although ultimately, the final determination about formatting and other aspect of the report will be made by the commission, as will be discussed in comment #51. Ameren Missouri’s suggestion to refer to “stakeholders” rather than “parties” is also reasonable, although the commission will retain the require- ment that other “stakeholders” to whom the report will be submitted must be approved by the commission. 
COMMENT #51: Ameren Missouri suggests the addition of a new subsection (9)(D), which will provide that any disagreements about the report content will be settled by the commission. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the change suggested by Ameren Missouri and will expand it to indicate the commission will ultimately settle any dis- agreements about formatting as well as content of the report. 
COMMENT #52: Subsection (14)(A) makes a reference to a semi- annual DSIM rate adjustment proceeding. Staff, as well as Ameren 

Page 1256

Orders of Rulemaking 

Missouri and KCP&L and GMO point out that DSIM rate adjust- ments are now due annually rather than semi-annually. The subsec- tion also provides that parties to the case in which a utility applies for approval of its demand-side programs have a right to be a party in any subsequent periodic rate adjustment proceedings without hav- ing to apply for intervention. However, the rule requires such person or entity to file a notice of intent to participate in the subsequent pro- ceeding. Public Counsel suggests language to make it clear that Public Counsel and staff do not need to file such notice to partici- pate. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff, Ameren Missouri, and KCP&L and GMO are correct. Semi-annual will be deleted. The commission agrees with Public Counsel that Public Counsel and staff do not need to file notice to participate in rate adjustment proceedings and will modify the subsection accordingly. The commission also notes that subsection (2)(A) contains two (2) distinct provisions and is better divided into two subsections. The subsequent subsection will be renumbered accordingly. 
COMMENT #53: Staff proposes a clarifying language change to subsection (15)(A). RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will make the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #54: Staff proposes a clarifying language change to subsection (15)(B). RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will make the change proposed by staff. 
4 CSR 240-20.093 Demand-Side Programs Investment Mechanisms 
(1) The definitions of terms used in this section can be found in 4 CSR 240-20.092 Definitions for Demand-Side Programs and Demand-Side Programs Investment Mechanisms. 
(2) Applications to establish, continue, or modify a Demand-Side Programs Investment Mechanism (DSIM). Pursuant to the provisions of this rule, 4 CSR 240-2.060, and section 393.1075, RSMo, an electric utility shall file an application with the commission to estab- lish, continue, or modify a DSIM in a utility’s filing for demand-side program approval. 
(A) An application to establish a DSIM shall include the following supporting information as part of, or in addition to, its direct testi- mony. Supporting workpapers shall be submitted with all models and spreadsheets provided as executable versions in native format with all links and formulas intact. 
1. The notice provided to customers describing how the pro- posed DSIM will work, how any proposed DSIM rate will be deter- mined, and how any DSIM rate will appear on customers’ bills; 
2. An example customer bill showing how the proposed DSIM shall be separately identified on affected customers’ bills; 
3. A complete, reasonably detailed, description and explanation of the design, rationale, and intended operation of the proposed DSIM; 
4. Estimates of the effect of the DSIM and all other impacts of the demand-side program spending, in aggregate, on customer rates and average bills for each of the next five (5) years, and as a net pre- sent value of net benefits over the lifetime of the demand-side pro- gram impacts, for each rate class; 
5. Estimates of the effect of the DSIM on earnings and key cred- it metrics for each of the next three (3) years including the level of earnings and key credit metrics expected to occur for each of the next three (3) years with and without the DSIM; 
6. A complete, reasonably detailed, explanation of all the costs that shall be considered for recovery under the proposed DSIM and the specific account used for each cost item on the electric utility’s books and records; 
7. A complete, reasonably detailed, explanation of any change in business risk to the electric utility resulting from implementation 
of a DSIM in setting the electric utility’s allowed return on equity, in addition to any other changes in business risk experienced by the electric utility; 
8. A proposal for how the commission can determine if the DSIM is aligned with helping customers use energy more efficient- ly; 
9. If the utility proposes to adjust its DSIM rates between gen- eral rate proceedings, proposed DSIM rate adjustment clause tariff sheets; and 
10. If the utility proposes to adjust the DSIM amount between general rate proceedings, a complete, reasonably detailed, explana- tion of how the DSIM rates shall be established and how they will be adjusted for any over- and/or under-recovery amounts, as well as the impact on the DSIM amount as a result of, established, modified, or discontinued demand-side programs. 
(B) If an electric utility files to modify its approved DSIM, the electric utility shall file with the commission and serve upon parties, as provided in section (15) below, the following supporting informa- tion as part of, or in addition to, direct testimony. Supporting work- papers shall be submitted with all models and spreadsheets provided as executable versions in native format with all links and formulas intact; 
1. Information as required by subsection (2)(A), above; 
2. Explanation of any proposed modification to the DSIM and why the proposed modification is being requested; 
3. A complete, reasonably detailed, explanation of any change in business risk to the electric utility resulting from modification of a DSIM in setting the electric utility’s allowed return on equity, in addition to any other changes in business risk experienced by the electric utility; and 
4. Any additional information the commission orders to be pro- vided. 
(C) Any party to the application for a utility’s filing for demand- side program approval may support or oppose the establishment, con- tinuation, or modification of a DSIM and/or may propose an alter- native DSIM for the commission’s consideration including, but not limited to, modifications to any electric utility’s proposed DSIM. 
(F) In determining to approve a request to establish, modify, or continue a DSIM, the commission may consider, but is not limited to only considering, the expected magnitude of the impact of the util- ity’s approved demand-side programs on the utility’s costs, revenues, and earnings, the ability of the utility to manage all aspects of the approved demand-side programs, the ability to measure and verify the approved demand-side programs’ impacts, any interaction among the various components of the DSIM that the utility may propose, and the incentives or disincentives provided to the utility as a result of the inclusion or exclusion of DSIM components as defined in 4 CSR 240-20.092(N). In this context the word “disincentives” means any barrier to the implementation of a DSIM. There is no penalty authorized in this section. 
(G) Any cost recovery component of a DSIM shall be based on costs of demand-side programs approved by the commission in accor- dance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand-Side Programs. Indirect costs associated with demand-side programs, including but not lim- ited to, costs of evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V), and/or utility’s portion of statewide technical reference manual, shall be allocated to demand-side programs and thus shall be eligible for recovery through an approved DSIM. The commission shall approve any cost recovery component of a DSIM simultaneously with the pro- grams approved in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand-Side Programs. 
(H) Any throughput disincentive component of DSIM shall be based on energy or energy and demand savings from utility demand- side programs approved by the commission in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand-Side Programs and will be determined as a result of energy and demand savings determined through EM&V. 
1. The commission shall order any throughput disincentive component of a DSIM simultaneously with the demand-side pro- grams approved in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand-Side

Programs. 2. In a utility’s filing in which a throughput disincentive com- 
ponent of a DSIM is considered, there is no requirement for any implicit or explicit utility throughput disincentive component of a DSIM or for a particular form of a throughput disincentive compo- nent of a DSIM. 
3. Any explicit throughput disincentive component of a DSIM shall be implemented on a prospective basis. 
(I) Any earnings opportunity component of a DSIM shall be based on the performance of demand-side programs approved by the com- mission in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand-Side Programs and shall include a methodology for determining the utili- ty’s earnings opportunity amount for individual demand-side pro- grams based upon program performance relative to commission- approved performance metrics for each demand-side program. 
1. Energy and demand savings targets approved by the commis- sion for use in the earnings opportunity component of a DSIM are not necessarily the same as the incremental energy and demand sav- ings goals and cumulative energy and demand savings goals specified in 4 CSR 240-20.094(2). 
2. The commission shall order any earnings opportunity compo- nent of a DSIM simultaneously with the approval of the demand-side programs in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand-Side Programs. 
3. Any earnings opportunity component of a DSIM shall be implemented on a retrospective basis and all energy and demand sav- ings used to determine a DSIM earnings opportunity amount must be measured and verified through EM&V. 
(J) If the DSIM proposed by the utility includes adjustments to DSIM rates between general rate proceedings, the DSIM shall include a provision to adjust the DSIM rates not less than annually to include a true-up for over- and under-recovery of the DSIM amount as well as the impact on the DSIM amount as a result of approved new, modified, or discontinued demand-side programs. 
(3) Application for Discontinuation of a DSIM. The commission shall allow or require a DSIM to be discontinued or any component of a DSIM to be discontinued only after providing the opportunity for a hearing. 
(A) When submitting an application to discontinue a DSIM, the electric utility shall file with the commission and serve on parties as provided in section (15), the following supporting information as part of, or in addition to, direct testimony. Supporting workpapers shall be submitted with all models and spreadsheets provided as executable versions in native format with all links and formulas intact: 
1. An example of the notice to be provided to customers; 
2. If the utility’s DSIM allows adjustments of the DSIM rates between general rate proceedings, a complete, reasonably detailed, explanation of how the over-/under-recovery of the DSIM amount that the electric utility is proposing to discontinue shall be handled; 
3. A complete, reasonably detailed, explanation of why the DSIM is no longer necessary to provide the electric utility a suffi- cient opportunity to recover demand-side programs costs, throughput disincentive, and/or to receive an earnings opportunity; 
4. A complete, reasonably detailed, explanation of any change in business risk to the electric utility resulting from discontinuation of the DSIM in setting the electric utility’s allowed return on equity, in addition to any other changes in business risk experienced by the electric utility; and 
5. Any additional information the commission orders to be pro- vided. 
(4) Requirements for Adjustments of DSIM Rates Between General Rate Proceedings. An electric utility with a DSIM shall file to adjust its DSIM rated no less often than annually. 
(A) The electric utility shall file tariff sheets to adjust its DSIM rates accompanied by supporting testimony and contain at least the following supporting information. All models and spreadsheets shall 
be provided as executable versions in native format with all links and formulas intact. 
1. Amount of revenue that it has over-/under-recovered through the most recent recovery period by rate class. 
2. Proposed positive or negative adjustments by rate class. 3. Electric utility’s short-term borrowing rate. 4. Proposed adjustments to the current DSIM rates. 5. Complete documentation for the proposed adjustments to the 
current DSIM rates. 6. Any additional information the commission ordered to be 
provided. (B) The staff shall examine and analyze the information filed by 
the electric utility and additional information obtained through dis- covery, if any, to determine if the proposed adjustments to the DSIM amount and DSIM rates are in accordance with the provisions of this rule, section 393.1075, RSMo, and the DSIM established, modified, or continued in the most recent filing for demand-side program approval. The staff shall submit a recommendation regarding its examination and analysis to the commission not later than thirty (30) days after the electric utility files its tariff sheets to adjust its DSIM rates. If the adjustments to the DSIM rates are in accordance with the provisions of this rule, section 393.1075, RSMo, and the DSIM established, modified, or continued in the most recent filing for demand-side program approval, the commission shall either issue an interim rate adjustment order approving the tariff sheets within sixty (60) days of the electric utility’s filing or, if no such order is issued, the adjustments to the DSIM rates shall take effect sixty (60) days after the tariff sheets were filed. If the adjustments to the DSIM rates are not in accordance with the provisions of this rule, section 393.1075, RSMo, or the DSIM established, modified, or continued in the most recent filing for demand-side program approval, the com- mission shall reject the proposed tariff sheets within sixty (60) days of the electric utility’s filing and may instead order the filing of inter- im tariff sheets that implement its decision. 
(C) Adjustments to the DSIM rates shall reflect a comprehensive measurement of both increases and decreases to the DSIM amount established in the most recent demand-side program approval or DSIM rate adjustment case plus the increases and decreases to the DSIM amount which occurred since the most recent demand-side program approval or DSIM rate adjustment case. All DSIM rate adjustments shall include a true-up of past DSIM collections based on the latest EM&V results where applicable. Any over-/under- recovered amounts will be accounted for in the going forward DSIM rates. 
(D) The electric utility shall be current on its submission of its Surveillance Monitoring Reports as required in section (10) and its annual reports as required in section (9) in order to increase the DSIM rates. 
(E) If the staff, public counsel, or other party believes the electric utility has not met the filing requirements of subsection (4)(A), it shall notify the electric utility within ten (10) days of the electric util- ity’s filing of an application or tariff sheets to adjust DSIM rates and identify the information required. The electric utility shall submit the information identified by the party, or shall notify the party that it believes the information submitted was in compliance with the requirements of subsection (4)(A), within ten (10) days of the request. A party who notifies the electric utility it believes the elec- tric utility has not submitted all the information required by subsec- tion (4)(A) and as ordered by the commission in a previous proceed- ing and receives notice from the electric utility that the electric utility believes it has submitted all required information may file a motion with the commission for an order directing the electric utility to pro- duce that information, i.e., a motion to compel. While the commis- sion is considering the motion to compel, the processing timeline for the adjustment to increase DSIM rates shall be suspended. If the commission then issues an order requiring the information be submit- ted, the time necessary for the information to be submitted shall fur- ther extend the processing timeline for the adjustment to increase

Orders of Rulemaking 

DSIM rates. For good cause shown, the commission may further sus- pend this timeline. Any delay in submitting sufficient information in compliance with subsection (4)(A) or a commission order in a previ- ous proceeding in a request to decrease DSIM rates shall not alter the processing timeline. 
(5) Implementation of DSIM. Once a DSIM is established, modified, or discontinued, in lieu of contemporaneous rate recovery the utility may request use of deferral accounting for MEEIA financial impacts using the utility’s latest approved weighted average cost of capital until the cut-off date for cost recognition ordered in the utility’s next general rate proceeding. 
(6) Duration of DSIM. Once a DSIM is approved by the commission, it shall remain in effect for the term established by the commission in the order approving that DSIM so as to allow full recovery of all DSIM amounts. During the term of an approved DSIM the utility or any party to the application for the utility’s filing for approval of a demand- side program may propose modifications to the DSIM. No modifica- tion of a utility’s DSIM shall be made without the assent of the utility. 
(7) Disclosure. Regardless of whether or not the utility requests adjustments of its DSIM rates between general rate proceedings, any amounts charged under a DSIM approved by the commission, includ- ing any earnings opportunity allowed by the commission, shall be separately disclosed on each customer’s bill. Proposed language regarding this disclosure shall be submitted to and approved by the commission before it appears on customers’ bills. The disclosure shall also appear on the utility’s websites. 
(8) Evaluation, Measurement, and Verification (EM&V) of the Process and Impact of Demand-Side Programs. Each electric utility shall hire an independent contractor to perform and report EM&V of each commission-approved demand-side program in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand-Side Programs. The utility shall provide oversight and guidance to the independent EM&V contractor, but shall not influence the independent EM&V contractor’s report(s). The commission shall hire an independent contractor to audit and report on the work of each utility’s independent EM&V contractor. The commission staff shall provide oversight and guidance to the independent commission contractor, but shall not influence the inde- pendent contractor’s audit(s). Staff counsel shall provide legal repre- sentation to the independent contractor in the event the independent contractor is required to testify before the commission. 
(A) Each utility’s EM&V budget shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the utility’s total budget for all approved demand-side pro- gram costs. 
(B) The cost of the commission’s EM&V contractor shall— 1. Not be a part of the utility’s budget for demand-side pro- 
grams; and 2. Be included in the Missouri Public Service Commission 
Assessment for each utility. (C) EM&V draft reports from the utility’s contractor for each 
approved demand-side program shall be delivered simultaneously to the utility and to parties of the case in which the demand-side pro- gram was approved. 
(D) EM&V final reports from the utility’s contractor of each approved demand-side program shall— 
1. Document, include analysis, and present any applicable rec- ommendations for at least the following. All models and spreadsheets shall be provided as executable versions in native format with all links and formulas intact: 
A. Process evaluation and recommendations, if any; and B. Impact evaluation— 
(I) The annual gross and net demand savings and energy sav- ings achieved under each demand-side program and the techniques used to estimate annual demand savings and energy savings; 
(II) For demand-side programs subject to cost-effectiveness 
tests, include total resource cost test, societal cost test, utility cost test, participant cost test, and nonparticipant cost test of each demand-side program; and 
(III) Determine the net benefits achieved for each demand- side program subject to cost-effectiveness tests and for the portfolio of such programs using the utility cost test (UCT) methodology; 
2. Be completed by the EM&V contractor on a schedule approved by the commission at the time of demand-side program approval in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094(4); and 
3. Be filed with the commission in the case in which the utility’s demand-side program approval was received and delivered simulta- neously to the utility and the parties of the case in which the demand- side program was approved. 
(E) Electric utility’s EM&V contractors shall— 1. Include specific methodology for performing EM&V work; 
and 2. Utilize the TRM approved with the utility’s application for its 
DSIM and demand-side portfolio. 
(9) Demand-Side Program Annual Report. Each electric utility with one (1) or more approved demand-side programs shall file an annual report by no later than ninety (90) days after the end of each program year, make a public version available for publication on the commis- sion’s website, and serve a copy on each party to the case in which the demand-side programs were last established, modified, or continued. Interested parties may file comments with the commission concerning the content of the utility’s annual report within thirty (30) days of its filing. Annual reports shall include at a minimum the following infor- mation, and all models and spreadsheets shall be provided as exe- cutable versions in native format with all links and formulas intact: 
(A) An affidavit attesting to the veracity of the information; and 
(B) A list of all approved demand-side programs and the following information for each approved demand-side program: 
1. Actual amounts expended by year, including customer incen- tive payments; 
2. Peak demand and energy savings impacts and the techniques used to estimate those impacts; 
3. A comparison of the estimated actual annual peak demand and energy savings impacts to the annual demand and energy savings targets approved by the commission under 4 CSR 240-20.094(4)(I) or 4 CSR 240-20.094(5)(A)5.; 
4. For market transformation demand-side programs, a quanti- tative and qualitative assessment of the progress being made in trans- forming the market; 
5. A comparison of actual and budgeted demand-side program costs, including an explanation of any increase or decrease of more than twenty percent (20%) in the cost of a demand-side program; 
6. The avoided costs and the techniques used to estimate those costs; 
7. The estimated cost-effectiveness of the demand-side program and a comparison to the estimates made by the utility at the time the demand-side program was approved;

10. As part of its annual report, the electric utility shall file or provide a reference to the commission case that contains a copy of the EM&V report for the most recent annual reporting period; and 
11. Demonstration of relationship of the demand-side programs to demand-side resources in latest filed 4 CSR 240-22 compliance filing. 
(10) Submission of Surveillance Monitoring Reports. Each electric utility with an approved DSIM shall submit to staff, public counsel, and parties approved by the commission a Surveillance Monitoring 
 
September 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 17 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 1259 

Report. Each electric utility with a DSIM shall submit, as page 6 of the Surveillance Monitoring Report, a quarterly progress report in a format agreed upon by the utility and staff, and all models and spreadsheets shall be provided as executable versions in native format with all links and formulas intact. The report shall be submitted to the staff, public counsel, and stakeholders approved by the commis- sion. 
(A) The Surveillance Monitoring Report shall be submitted within fifteen (15) days of the electric utility’s next scheduled United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 10-Q or 10-K filing with the initial submission within fifteen (15) days of the electric utility’s next scheduled SEC 10-Q or 10-K filing following the effective date of the commission order establishing the DSIM. 
(B) If the electric utility also has an approved environmental cost recovery mechanism or a fuel cost adjustment mechanism, the elec- tric utility shall submit a single Surveillance Monitoring Report for all mechanisms. 
(C) Upon a finding that a utility has knowingly or recklessly pro- vided materially false or inaccurate information to the commission regarding the surveillance data prescribed in this section, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the commission may suspend a DSIM or order other appropriate remedies as provided by law. 
(D) Disagreements about the report format or content shall be set- tled by the commission. 
(11) Prudence Reviews. A prudence review of the costs subject to the DSIM shall be conducted no less frequently than at twenty-four- (24-) month intervals. 
(A) All amounts ordered refunded by the commission shall include interest at the electric utility’s short-term borrowing rate. 
(B) The staff shall submit a recommendation regarding its exami- nation and analysis to the commission not later than one hundred fifty (150) days after the staff initiates its prudence audit. The timing and frequency of prudence audits for DSIM shall be established in the utility’s filing for demand-side program approval in which the DSIM is established. The staff shall file notice within ten (10) days of starting its prudence audit. The commission shall issue an order not later than two hundred ten (210) days after the staff commences its prudence audit if no party to the proceeding in which the prudence audit is occurring files, within one hundred sixty (160) days of the staff’s commencement of its prudence audit, a request for a hearing. 
1. If the staff, public counsel, or other party auditing the DSIM believes that insufficient information has been supplied to make a recommendation regarding the prudence of the electric utility’s DSIM, it may utilize discovery to obtain the information it seeks. If the electric utility does not timely supply the information, the party asserting the failure to provide the required information must timely file a motion to compel with the commission. While the commission is considering the motion to compel, the processing timeline shall be suspended. If the commission then issues an order requiring the information to be provided, the time necessary for the information to be provided shall further extend the processing timeline. For good cause shown, the commission may further suspend this timeline. 
2. If the timeline is extended due to an electric utility’s failure to timely provide sufficient responses to discovery and a refund is due to the customers, the electric utility shall refund all imprudently incurred costs plus interest at the electric utility’s short-term borrow- ing rate. 
(12) Tariffs and Regulatory Plans. The provisions of this rule shall not affect— 
(A) Any adjustment mechanism, rate schedule, tariff, incentive plan, or other ratemaking mechanism that was approved by the com- mission and in effect prior to the effective date of this rule; and 
(B) Any experimental regulatory plan that was approved by the commission and in effect prior to the effective date of this rule. 
(13) Nothing in this rule shall preclude a complaint case from being filed, as provided by law. 
(14) Variances. Upon request and for good cause shown, the commis- sion may grant a variance from any provision of this rule. 
(15) Party status and providing to other parties affidavits, testimony, information, reports, and workpapers in related proceedings subse- quent to the utility’s filing for demand-side program approval, modifi- cation, or continuation of a DSIM. 
(A) A person or entity granted intervention in a utility’s filing for demand-side program approval in which a DSIM is approved by the commission shall have the right to be a party to any subsequent relat- ed periodic rate adjustment proceeding without the necessity of applying to the commission for intervention; however, such person or entity shall file a notice of intention to participate within the inter- vention period. Public Counsel and the commission’s staff do not need to file a notice of intention to participate. In any subsequent util- ity’s filing for demand-side program approval, such person or entity must seek and be granted status as an intervenor to be a party to that proceeding. 
(B) Affidavits, testimony, information, reports, and workpapers to be filed or submitted in connection with a subsequent related annual DSIM rate adjustment proceeding or utility’s filing for demand-side program approval to modify, continue, or discontinue the same DSIM shall be served on or submitted to all parties from the prior related demand-side program approval proceeding and on all parties from any subsequent related periodic rate adjustment proceeding or utility’s fil- ing for demand-side program approval to modify, continue, or discon- tinue the same DSIM, concurrently with filing the same with the com- mission or submitting the same to the manager of the energy resource analysis section of the staff and public counsel. 
(C) A person or entity not a party to the utility’s filing for demand- side program approval in which a DSIM is approved by the commis- sion may timely apply to the commission for intervention, pursuant to 4 CSR 240-2.075(2) through (4) of the commission’s rule on inter- vention, respecting any related subsequent periodic rate adjustment proceeding or, pursuant to 4 CSR 240-2.075(1) through (5), respect- ing any subsequent utility’s filing for demand-side program approval to modify, continue, or discontinue the same DSIM. 
(16) Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act (MEEIA) Rate Design Modifications. 
(A) An electric utility may request modification of its DSIM rates by filing tariff schedule(s) with the commission as part of— 
1. An application for approval of demand-side programs or a demand-side program plan and a DSIM; or 
2. A general rate case proceeding. (B) Any request for modification of a rate design shall include with 
the filing supporting documentation for the request, including but not limited to, workpapers, data, computer model documentation, analy- sis, and other supporting information to support and explain the mod- ification of the rate design. All information shall be labeled and all spreadsheets shall be provided as executable versions with all links and formulas intact. 
(C) Right to Discovery Unaffected. In addressing certain discovery matters and the provision of certain information by electric utilities, this rule is not intended to restrict the discovery rights of any party.

ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Public Service Commission under sec- tions 393.1075.11 and 393.1075.15, RSMo 2016, the commission 

Page 1260 
September 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 17 

Orders of Rulemaking 

amends a rule as follows: 4 CSR 240-20.094 is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on February 1, 2017 (42 MoReg 168–174). Those sections with changes are reprint- ed here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended April 27, 2017, and the commission held a public hearing on the pro- posed amendment on May 4, 2017. The commission received timely written comments from the Office of the Public Counsel; Union Electric Company, d/b/a Ameren Missouri; Kansas City Power & Light Company (KCP&L) and KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company (GMO); Renew Missouri; the Missouri Department of Economic Development - Division of Energy; the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC); Walmart Stores, Inc.; the National Housing Trust; the Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance; and the staff of the commission. In addition, the following people offered comments at the hearing: Martin Hyman and Barbara Meisenheimer on behalf of the Division of Energy; Andrew Linhares on behalf of Renew Missouri; Phil Fracica on behalf of Energy Efficiency for All; David Woodsmall on behalf of Walmart; Tim Opitz and Geoff Marke on behalf of the Public Counsel; Lewis Mills on behalf of the Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers (MIEC); Jim Fischer and Tim Nelson on behalf of KCP&L and GMO; Paula Johnson and Bill Davis on behalf of Ameren Missouri; and Natelle Dietrich, John Rogers, Robert Berlin, and Brad Fortson on behalf of staff. Many comments and suggested changes were offered. The commission will address those comments as they pertain to the various provisions of the rule. 
COMMENT #1: In section (1) staff would make demand-side pro- gram plural. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #2: Section (2) establishes non-binding energy and demand savings goals for utilities to strive to meet. The goals are only aspirational and the utilities will not incur any penalty if they fail to achieve the goals. The NRDC, the National Housing Trust and Renew Missouri strongly support the inclusion of the goals. The NRDC and Renew Missouri would go further and attempt to autho- rize the commission to impose “adverse consequences” or “penal- ties” on utilities that fail to achieve the established goals. Public Counsel urges the commission to delete the savings goals entirely, contending that the goals provide little value to the MEEIA process and are not used by the utilities in evaluating their MEEIA portfo- lios. 
RESPONSE: The commission will retain the aspirational goals. They have some value as a measuring stick for the utilities. The com- mission will not, however, attempt to make these goals anything more than aspirational. The MEEIA statute does not require utilities to participate, and the commission cannot change that fact. 
COMMENT #3: Subsection (2)(A) establishes the energy and demand savings goals for electric utilities and explains how those savings are to be reviewed. The proposed subsection directs the com- mission to use the greater of the annual “realistic” amount of achiev- able energy savings and demand savings as determined by a market potential study, or the goals listed in the subsection to determine the utility’s progress toward the goal of all cost-effective demand-side savings. The NRDC, Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, and Renew Missouri urge the commission to replace “realistic” savings with “maximum” savings. The Division of Energy would simply delete “realistic,” and would simplify the last sentence of the subsec- tion. Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance also seeks clarification of 
whether “total annual energy” in the goals refers to the energy load served by the utility before or after customer opt-out is taken into consideration. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will not adopt the Division of Energy’s suggestion to remove “realistic” from the description of achievable savings because the term that would remain, “achievable savings” is not a defined term. In addition, the Division of Energy’s simplification of the last sen- tence of the subsection is appropriate and will be adopted. Total annual energy in the goals refers to the energy load served after cus- tomer opt-out is taken into consideration. 
COMMENT #4: Subsection (2)(B) establishes cumulative energy and demand savings goals for electric utilities and explains how those savings are to be reviewed. Staff proposes modification of the sub- section to refer to the cumulative “annual” amount of “achievable” energy and demand savings. The NRDC, Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, and Renew Missouri urge the commission to replace “real- istic” savings with “maximum” savings. The Division of Energy would simply delete “realistic,” and would simplify the last sentence of the subsection. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will not adopt the Division of Energy’s suggestion to remove “realistic” from the description of cost-effectively achievable energy and demand savings because the term that would remain, “achievable savings” is not a defined term. In addition, the Division of Energy’s simplification of the last sentence of the subsection is appropriate and will be adopted. Staff’s modification will also be adopted. 
COMMENT #5: Paragraph (2)(B)9. establishes a savings target for the utility’s approved ninth program year and thereafter. Staff notes that a reference to the year 2020 in the paragraph should be changed to “approve ninth year” to be consistent with the rest of the para- graph. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The change proposed by staff will be adopted. 
COMMENT #6: Section (3) is entitled “Utility Market Potential Studies.” The NRDC and Renew Missouri urge the commission to change that title to “Statewide Market Potential Study” in keeping with their proposal to require the exclusive use of the statewide mar- ket potential study by all electric utilities. The Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance offers a general comment calling the commis- sion’s attention to recently passes legislation in Michigan that autho- rizes the Michigan commission to conduct a statewide energy effi- ciency potential study. 
RESPONSE: The commission intends to continue to allow the use of utility-specific market potential studies and will not adopt the change proposed by the NRDC and Renew Missouri. 
COMMENT #7: Subsection (3)(A) describes the preparation of a market potential study. The National Housing Trust supports the requirement for consideration of both primary and secondary data. It also supports the aspect of the rule that requires the utility to permit stakeholder input and review. The Division of Energy would add a long description of the purpose of a market potential study. RESPONSE: The commission does not believe the extra details sug- gested by the Division of Energy are necessary. The proposed changes will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #8: Regarding paragraph (3)(A)1., Public Counsel would specify various types of studies that should be incorporated in the market potential study. RESPONSE: The commission does not believe the additional speci- fications proposed by Public Counsel are necessary. The proposed change will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #9: Regarding paragraph (3)(A)2., Public Counsel 
 
September 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 17 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 1261 

would require utility market potential studies to be updated every three (3) years rather than every four (4) years. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with Public Counsel that an update every three (3) years is appropriate. The proposed change will be adopted. 
COMMENT #10: Paragraph (3)(A)3. requires the utility market potential study to be prepared by an independent third party. Public Counsel would add language intended to protect the independence of the third party from undue influence by the utility. The NRDC pro- poses that the market potential study be procured and managed by an unidentified state entity, in keeping with its desire to compel use of a single statewide market potential study. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the additional language proposed by Public Counsel to protect the independence of the contractor engaged to produce the utility market potential study. The NRDC’s proposal will not be adopted as the commission wants to continue to allow for the use of utility-specific market potential studies. In addition, there is no state entity available to perform that function. 
COMMENT #11: Paragraph (3)(A)4. provides that a utility market potential study must include an estimate of the achievable potential savings from low-income demand-side programs, regardless of cost- effectiveness. KCP&L and GMO suggest the first sentence of the paragraph be deleted because the phrase is not defined. RESPONSE: The commission believes that the paragraph as pro- posed is appropriate and will not adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #12: The Division of Energy and Public Counsel pro- pose additional paragraphs that prescribe additional details that must be addressed in a utility market potential study. RESPONSE: The commission will not adopt any of the proposed additional prescriptive requirements. Prescribing additional require- ments is not necessary as it may be presumed that the experts engaged to perform the study will be able to perform an appropriate study without the imposition of inflexible standards within the regu- lation. 
COMMENT #13: Subsection (3)(B) requires the utility engaging a market potential study to allow an opportunity for staff and stake- holder review and input in the planning stages of the study. The National Housing Trust strongly supports that requirement. The NRDC would insert a reference to its concept of having an unidenti- fied state entity assume the role of the utility in eliciting input about the planning of the study. 
RESPONSE: The commission thanks the National Housing Trust for its comment. The commission has not accepted the NRDC’s propos- al to use a state entity to procure a market potential study and will not adopt the proposed change to this subsection. 
COMMENT #14: Section (4) allows an electric utility to apply for approval of a demand-side portfolio. Staff proposes insertion of an missing “a” as a grammatical correction. Ameren Missouri proposes the use of “portfolio” to replace “program plans” in the first sentence of the section. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt both proposed changes. 
COMMENT #15: Among other things, subsection (4)(B) requires the utility to provide certain workpapers with all formulas intact. Staff would add that links must also be provided intact. The NRDC would insert a reference to market potential documents prepared by an undefined state entity. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the change proposed by staff. The commission will not adopt NRDC’s proposal to designate a state agency to prepare a statewide market potential study and, therefore, will not adopt the 
change proposed by the NRDC. 
COMMENT #16: Staff proposes a change to paragraph (4)(B)1. to ensure that the market potential study that the utility must submit contains information specific to the service territory of that utility. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Staff’s proposed change is appropriate and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #17: KCP&L and GMO suggest that paragraphs (4)(B)1. through (4)(B)3. are requirements for a market potential study that are more properly moved to section (3), which relates to market potential studies. 
RESPONSE: The commission disagrees with KCP&L and GMO. The requirements are related to the market potential study, but the paragraphs require the utility to provide information that the commis- sion needs to see in relation to the utility’s application for approval of its demand-side programs or portfolio. The requirements are appropriately included in this section and KCP&L and GMO’s pro- posed change will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #18: Paragraph (4)(B)2. requires an electric utility’s application for approval of demand-side programs to include a description of the process and assumptions used to determine techni- cal potential, economic potential, maximum achievable potential and realistic achievable potential for each customer class. The NRDC suggests the requirement to describe realistic achievable potential be deleted from the paragraph. 
RESPONSE: The commission believes a description of the way that the realistic achievable potential was determined will be helpful. The commission will not adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #19: Subparagraph (4)(B)3.C. requires an electric util- ity’s application for approval of demand-side programs to include a twenty (20) year baseline energy and demand forecast that includes an account of changes in customer combined heat and power appli- cations. Staff would modify that requirement to refer only to “natu- rally occurring” customer applications to be consistent with the def- inition of baseline demand forecast and baseline energy forecast else- where in these rules. Public Counsel would delete the subparagraph as unnecessary. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion believes the information required will be useful and will not delete the subparagraph. The change proposed by staff will be adopt- ed. 
COMMENT #20: Subsection (4)(C) requires an electric utility’s application for approval of demand-side programs to include a demonstration of the cost-effectiveness of the proposed demand-side programs. The paragraphs under that subsection describe the items to be included in that demonstration. The NRDC suggests the utility be required to provide all workpapers related to its demonstration. The Division of Energy would specifically exclude programs targeted to low-income customers, which do not need to be demonstrated to be cost-effective as provided in section 393.1075.4, RSMo. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with the proposal offered by the NRDC and it will be adopted. The Division of Energy correctly points out that programs targeted to low-income customers do not need to be demonstrated to be cost effective. However, for analysis purposes it is preferable to be able to see the cost-effectiveness of the utility’s entire portfolio, including programs targeted to low-income customers. The change proposed by the Division of Energy will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #21: Paragraph (4)(C)1. requires an electric utility to include a description of its calculation of its total resource cost test (TRC) and its avoided costs calculations. Staff would make the word cost plural. Public Counsel would add a reference to the utility’s earnings opportunity.

Orders of Rulemaking 

RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the change proposed by staff. Public Counsel’s addi- tional reference would vary from the statutory definition of TRC and will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #22: Paragraph (4)(C)2. contains a reference to the “non-participant test.” The definition of “non-participant test” found in subsection 4 CSR 240-20.092(1)(JJ) has been replaced with a def- inition of “ratepayer impact measure (RIM) test” in subsection 4 CSR 240-20.092(1)(NN). The reference in this paragraph should be changed accordingly. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will make the necessary change. 
COMMENT #23: Paragraph (4)(C)3. requires an electric utility to include a description of impact on revenue requirements resulting from the integration analysis performed as part of the utility’s inte- grated resource planning under Chapter 22 of the commission’s rules. The Division of Energy would delete this requirement because it opposes the linkage of the MEEIA process with the Chapter 22 integrated resource planning process. 
RESPONSE: As previously indicated, the commission believes the linkage with the Chapter 22 integrated resource planning process is appropriate and necessary. The commission will not adopt the change proposed by the Division of Energy. 
COMMENT #24: Staff proposes to create a new paragraph (4)(C)4. that would require an electric utility to include a description of the impact on annual earnings opportunity of postponement of new sup- ply side resources and the early retirement of existing supply side resources as a result of all demand-side programs included in the application. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with staff that the additional information will be helpful. The proposed change, using slightly different language, will be adopted. 
COMMENT #25: Subsection (4)(D) requires an electric utility to include a description of each proposed demand-side program. Multiple paragraphs within that subsection then set out the details of what must be included in that description. The NRDC suggests the utility be required to provide all workpapers related to its description. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with the NRDC and will adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #26: Public Counsel proposes a change to paragraph (4)(D)2. that would clarify that the description of each proposed demand-side program include individual measures and program-spe- cific TRC ratios. 
RESPONSE: Requiring that level of description for individual pro- grams is unnecessary and unduly onerous. Measure level cost-effec- tiveness will be contained in the market potential studies. The com- mission will not adopt the change proposed by Public Counsel. 
COMMENT #27: Public Counsel proposes a change to paragraph (4)(D)3. that would require a description of “customer incentives ranges” rather than “customer incentives.” RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with Public Counsel that the change will help clarify the requirements of the paragraph. The proposed change will be adopt- ed. 
COMMENT #28: Paragraph (4)(D)6. requires the utility to provide a description of projected gross and net annual energy savings for each proposed demand-side program. The NRDC recommends the para- graph be expanded to require a description of lifetime energy savings as well. It argues that lifetime energy savings most closely correlates with the value of benefits to the economy and to ratepayers. Public 
Counsel recommends the paragraph be deleted for clarity. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with the NRDC that lifetime energy savings should also be described. That change will be adopted. Public Counsel does not explain why deleting the paragraph will improve clarity, and that change will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #29: Paragraph (4)(D)7. requires the utility to provide a description of proposed annual and cumulative energy savings tar- gets. Staff would simplify that requirement to just proposed energy savings targets. Staff indicates the change is needed to be consistent with the definition of energy savings target found in subsection 20.092(1)(X). 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with staff and will adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #30: Paragraph (4)(D)8. requires the utility to provide a description of projected gross and net annual demand savings. Public Counsel recommends the paragraph be deleted for clarity. RESPONSE: Public Counsel does not explain why deleting the para- graph will improve clarity, and that change will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #31: Paragraph (4)(D)9. requires the utility to provide a description of proposed annual demand savings targets and cumu- lative demand savings targets. Staff would simplify that requirement to just proposed demand savings targets to be consistent with the def- inition of demand savings target found in subsection 4 CSR 240- 20.092(1)(O). 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with staff and will adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #32: Paragraph (4)(D)10. requires the utility to provide a description of net-to-gross factors. Public Counsel would limit that description of those factors to just free ridership and spillover. RESPONSE: Public Counsel does not explain why the description of net-to-gross factors should be limited to just those two (2) factors. The commission will not adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #33: Paragraph (4)(D)12. requires the utility to provide a description of certain market transformation elements. Staff rec- ommends some clarifications to the requirement. Public Counsel would delete the entire paragraph for clarification. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the clarifications proposed by staff. Public Counsel does not explain why deleting the paragraph will clarify the rule. That proposed change will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #34: Paragraph (4)(D)13. requires the utility to provide a description of its EM&V plan. Public Counsel would delete the entire paragraph for clarification. RESPONSE: Public Counsel does not explain why deleting the para- graph will clarify the rule. The proposed change will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #35: Paragraph (4)(D)15. requires the utility to provide a description of all strategies used to minimize free riders. Public Counsel would delete the entire paragraph for clarification. RESPONSE: Public Counsel does not explain why deleting the para- graph will clarify the rule. The proposed change will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #36: Paragraph (4)(D)16. requires the utility to provide a description of all strategies used to maximize spillover. Public Counsel would delete the entire paragraph for clarification. RESPONSE: Public Counsel does not explain why deleting the para- graph will clarify the rule. The proposed change will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #37: Public Counsel would add a paragraph to subsec- tion (4)(D) that would require the utility to describe a detailed noti- fication plan to inform customer classes and trade allies when the utility’s portfolio budget will be exhausted. 
 
September 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 17 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 1263 

RESPONSE: The commission does not believe the sharp restrictions on the utility’s portfolio budget proposed by Public Counsel are nec- essary or appropriate. The proposed change will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #38: Subsection (4)(E) requires a utility to demonstrate and explain how its proposed demand-side programs will progress toward the statutory goal of achieving all cost-effective demand-side savings. The subsection also requires the utility to explain any short- fall from the non-binding goals established in section (2). Public Counsel would delete the requirement to explain any shortfall, as it also proposes to delete the non-binding goals established in section (2). 
RESPONSE: The commission has not deleted the non-binding goals established in section (2). While those goals are not binding on the utilities, the commission believes that an explanation should be given if those goals are not met. The commission will not adopt the pro- posed change. 
COMMENT #39: Subsection (4)(G) concerns the utility’s designa- tion of program pilots; demand-side programs that are designed to operate on a limited basis for evaluation purposes. Public Counsel would add an explicit reference to research and development as an alternative to program pilots. It explains the change is necessary to reflect Cycle II program considerations regarding research and devel- opment. The Division of Energy would modify the consideration given to program pilots targeted to low-income customers by exempt- ing them from demonstrating cost-effectiveness because they do not need to be shown to be cost-effective as provided in section 393.1075.4, RSMo. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Public Counsel’s proposed change to include research and development in the subsec- tion appears to reflect a change in preferred terminology. However, research and development fits easily within the term, “program pilot.” Cluttering the subsection by adding the alternative terminology is not necessary. The commission will not adopt Division of Energy’s pro- posal regarding cost-effectiveness testing. While programs targeted to low-income customers do not need to pass a cost-effectiveness test to be approved, there is value to the commission in knowing whether such programs are cost-effective. 
COMMENT #40: Staff proposes a change to subsection (4)(H) to remove a redundant definition of Demand-Side Program Investment Mechanism (DSIM). RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with staff and will adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #41: Subsection (4)(I) discusses the demand-side pro- grams and program plans that may be approved. Staff proposes to add “budget” to the list of items that must be approved by the com- mission. Also, the subsection references “annual” demand and ener- gy savings targets. The definitions of demand savings targets and energy savings targets at 4 CSR 240-20.092(1)(O) and 4 CSR 240- 20.092(1)(X) have been changed to remove “annual” so this refer- ence to those terms must also be changed. The National Housing Trust supports the subsection’s designation of the TRC as a preferred cost-effectiveness test. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #42: Paragraph (4)(I)3. requires that to be approved, a demand-side program must have been considered in the utility’s inte- grated resource planning (IRP) process to determine the impact of the programs on the net present value of revenue requirements of the util- ity. The Division of Energy would delete the entire paragraph to avoid the linkage of MEEIA with the IRP process. 
RESPONSE: The commission believes that the IRP provides an essential baseline for evaluating the impact of demand-side programs. The Division of Energy’s proposal to delete the paragraph will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #43: Subsection (4)(J) establishes the circumstances in which the commission will approve demand-side programs targeted to low-income customers or general education campaigns. Staff pro- poses minor wording changes to clarify the rule and to correct an incorrect rule citation. The Division of Energy proposes to delete the portion of the rule that refers to demand-side programs that have a total resource cost test ratio of less than one (1) for programs targeted to low-income customers or for general education campaigns. The Division of Energy explains that the MEEIA statute, section 393.1075(4), RSMo, provides that such programs do not need to meet a cost-effectiveness test so long as the commission finds them to be in the public interest. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the clarification proposed by staff. Also, the Division of Energy is correct, demand-side programs targeted to low-income customers or for general education campaigns do not need to meet any cost-effectiveness test. The commission will adopt the proposed change. The commission also notes that subsection (J) includes a paragraph 1., but not any subsequent paragraphs. To avoid having a single paragraph, the existing paragraph 1. will be incorporated into subsection (J). 
COMMENT #44: Staff recommends the correction of a rule refer- ence in subsection (4)(K). RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #45: Subsection (4)(M) indicates the commission shall approve, approve with modifications acceptable to the utility, or reject the utility’s DSIM proposal at the same time it acts on the util- ity’s application for approval of its demand-side programs. The NRDC urges the commission to delete the requirement that any mod- ifications in the programs must be acceptable to the utility. RESPONSE: Utility participation in MEEIA is optional. The com- mission has no authority to force any changes in the program on the utility. If the utility does not approve of the modifications it has the option of refusing to participate in MEEIA. Of course, if the utility chooses not to implement programs acceptable to the commission, it loses out on the benefits it would receive from that participation. But that choice belongs to the utility. The commission will not adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #46: Paragraph (5)(A)1. specifies when a utility must file an application for modification of its demand-side programs to address overruns in its budget for implementation of those programs. The proposed amendment requires such an application be filed if there is a variance of forty percent (40%) or more from the approved budget. Staff would reduce that to a twenty percent (20%) variance. Staff also proposes some language changes to clarify the paragraph. Public Counsel would eliminate the variance allowance entirely and require the utilities to strictly adhere to their approved budgets. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion believes that utilities need to have some flexibility in their adher- ence to approved budgets. Otherwise, they will have a strong incen- tive to be unduly conservative in their decisions about which pro- grams they will agree to offer. The commission will reduce the allowed variance to twenty percent (20%) as proposed by staff and will make the clarifying changes proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #47: Paragraph (5)(A)2. requires a utility to file an application to modify its demand-side programs under certain cir- cumstances. Staff, KCP&L and GMO, and Ameren Missouri urge the commission to delete this paragraph because it unduly restricts the utilities’ ability to manage their approved demand-side programs. The Division of Energy also believes the paragraph is unduly restric- tive, but suggests it could be retained if the “shall” file an application is changed to “may” file an application. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees the paragraph is unduly restrictive and will delete it. The 

Page 1264 
September 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 17 

Orders of Rulemaking 

remaining paragraphs in that subsection are renumbered accordingly. 
COMMENT #48: Paragraph (5)(A)3. requires a utility’s application to modify demand-side programs to include an explanation of the proposed changes. Ameren Missouri suggests that the requirement of a “complete” explanation be replaced with a “reasonably detailed” explanation, reasoning that a “complete” description is unattainable. The paragraph requires the utility to provide certain workpapers with all formulas intact. Staff would add that links must also be provided intact. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion understands Ameren Missouri’s concern, but the requirement of a “complete” description should not be weakened to the extent that a utility would be able to hide any aspect of its proposed modification. The commission will alter the paragraph to require a “complete, rea- sonably detailed” description. The commission will make the same change in paragraph (6)(A)1. The commission will adopt the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #49: Staff recommends a rule reference correction in paragraph (5)(A)6. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #50: Subsection (6)(A) requires the utility to provide certain workpapers with all formulas intact. Staff would add that links must also be provided intact. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #51: Paragraph (6)(A)2. requires the utility applying to discontinue demand-side programs to provide the EM&V reports for the demand-side program in question. KCP&L and GMO explain that such EM&V report might not yet be available at the time the application is filed. They suggest the paragraph be modified to rec- ognize that fact. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #52: Subsection (6)(B) describes steps an electric util- ity must take if demand-side program subject to the TRC is deter- mined to be not cost-effective. The Division of Energy would modify the subsection to clarify that it does not apply to demand-side pro- grams directed to low-income customers or general education cam- paigns that are not subject to a cost-effectiveness test under the MEEIA statute. Ameren Missouri would modify the subsection to achieve the same purpose as the Division of Energy, but using differ- ent language. Public Counsel would delete the entire subsection as unnecessary and unduly burdensome on the utilities. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion believes that the information to be provided in this subsection will be helpful in determining why the existing demand-side program failed and how a more successful program can be implemented. It is not unduly burdensome on the utilities and none of the utilities that filed comments indicated any such concern. The commission agrees with the concerns raised by the Division of Energy and Ameren Missouri. The language proposed by Ameren Missouri best resolves the concern and will be adopted. 
COMMENT #53: Section (7) deals with large utility customers that the MEEIA statute allows to opt-out of participation in MEEIA. Subsection (7)(A) reiterates the statute’s listing of three (3) types of customers who may opt-out of MEEIA. Paragraph (7)(A)1. allows a customer who has “one (1) or more accounts within the service ter- ritory of the electric utility that has a demand of the individual accounts of five thousand (5,000) kW or more in the previous twelve (12) months.” Under the statute, section 393.1075.7(1), RSMo, the qualifying customer need only inform the utility that it is opting-out 
of MEEIA and thereby avoid paying any MEEIA related costs that must be paid by the utility’s other customer. Walmart - which has multiple accounts that total well more than five thousand (5,000) kW, but which does not have any individual accounts reaching that total - asks the commission to clarify paragraph (7)(A)1. to allow it to qual- ify for opt-out under that provision. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion understands Walmart’s concern. But what Walmart is asking the commission to do is a modification of the clear words of the statute, which allows opt-out under the first threshold only for a customer who has “one (1) or more accounts within the service territory of the electrical corporation that has a demand of five thousand (5,000) kilowatts or more.” The commission cannot modify the words of the statute to meet Walmart’s request. 
In considering Walmart’s request, the commission notes that the existing language of the rule varies from the language of the statute. The commission will modify paragraph (7)(A)1. to track the lan- guage of the statute. 
COMMENT #54: Paragraph (7)(A)3. regards large customers who have accounts within the utility’s service territory that have, in aggre- gate, a demand of two thousand five hundred (2,500) or more kW. Walmart meets this criteria. Unlike customers who can opt-out under the five thousand (5,000) kW threshold, customers who qualify under this threshold must also demonstrate an “achievement of sav- ings at least equal to those expected from utility-provided programs.” Renew Missouri suggests that the large customers who seek to qual- ify for opt-out under this threshold be required to make the documen- tation supporting their claim publicly available on the commission’s website. Walmart and the Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers (MIEC) adamantly opposed the public disclosure of their energy effi- ciency efforts because the details of those efforts are competitively sensitive and should not be publically disclosed. The Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance is also concerned about the documenta- tion opt-out customers must provide to meet the third threshold and suggest they provide an EM&V report that adheres to the same guidelines and level of rigor required of utility-provided demand-side savings programs. 
Walmart and Renew Missouri also express concern that there is no clear standard to determine whether a customer seeking to opt-out under the third threshold has met the required level of savings. KCP&L and GMO proposed the establishment of five percent (5%) of the customer annual kilowatt hour usage as the standard to be met. Walmart pointed out that such standard is arbitrary, and might be unfair if the utility’s actual savings were either more or less than that amount. Walmart suggests that staff make an explicit statement in its approval of each utility’s MEEIA programs as to the level of savings that can be expected from utility-provided programs. That would then be the standard by which opt-out customers are measured. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will not require that customer documentation be made available to the public. The commission does not regulate the customers of the electric utilities and any public interest in seeing the documentation they submit is outweighed by the customer’s interest in protecting that information from disclosure to competitors. The question of establishing a standard that opt-out customers must meet is difficult and none of the commenters offered an acceptable solution. KCP&L and GMO’s suggestion of a five percent (5%) standard is arbitrary and potentially unfair. There really is no good solution for this prob- lem. The comments acknowledged that staff is currently doing a good job evaluating opt-out decisions without a clear standard. It will have to continue to do so. The commission will modify the paragraph by deleting the “catch-all” provision in subparagraph (7)(A)3.D. as unnecessary. 
COMMENT #55: Paragraph (7)(A)4. provides that opt-outs under the third threshold are valid only for the term of the MEEIA cycle approved by the commission. With each new cycle, the opt-out customers would 
 
September 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 17 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 1265 

again need to apply. Walmart opposes the limitation of the opt-out period for two (2) reasons. First, the term of the MEEIA cycle is unlikely to correspond to the window for submission of opt-out requests established in the rule. Second, Walmart contends any limi- tation of the effectiveness of an opt-out should be tied to the statutory comparison of achieved savings. So long as the customer’s savings meet or exceed the savings anticipated from the utility’s program, the customer should be able to remain opted-out. KCP&L and GMO would make the time limited opt-out apply to customer’s opting-out under all three (3) thresholds. It would also base the opt-out periods on calendar years, rather than MEEIA cycles to avoid the conflict with the opt-out window. Ameren Missouri would tie the opt-out period to the implementation period rather than the MEEIA cycle. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with the commenters that the length of a MEEIA cycle is not an appropriate limitation on an opt-out. The need to reapply fre- quently would be burdensome on the customers wishing to opt-out and would ignore the fact that many energy saving measures do not expire in a short amount of time. It is also appropriate to set a time for opt-out customers under the first and second thresholds to reaf- firm their notice to opt-out. The commission will require all opt-out customers to reaffirm their opt-out at least once every ten (10) years. 
COMMENT #56: Ameren Missouri commented that paragraph (7)(A)4. would be better denominated as subparagraph (7)(A)3.G. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: After reviewing the make-up of section (7), the commission concludes that a more extensive renumbering is needed. Subparagraph (7)(A)3.E. and F. are better denominated as new subsections (B) and (C). Paragraph (7)(A)4. will then be denominated as subsection (D). All subsequent subsections will be renumbered accordingly. 
COMMENT #57: Staff recommends a change in subsection (7)(B) to use a corrected title for the portion of the commission’s staff to whom written notification of opt-out is to be submitted. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #58: Paragraph (7)(F)1. establishes a period between September 1 and October 30 of each year in which opt-out notices can be submitted by customers. The paragraph provides that such notices are to be effective for the next program year. Ameren Missouri and KCP&L and GMO advise the commission to change program year to calendar year. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees and will adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #59: Paragraph (7)(F)2. describes the effective date of and possible cancellation of a customer’s opt-out. Staff proposes some clarifying changes to the paragraph. Ameren Missouri and KCP&L and GMO would change program year to calendar year. KCP&L and GMO would also expand the paragraph to include cus- tomers seeking opt-out under the first and second thresholds as well. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees that program year should be changed to calendar year. To be consistent with other changes to the rule, this paragraph will be made to apply to customers seeking opt-out under thresholds one (1) and two (2) as well as three (3). 
COMMENT #60: Subsection (7)(H) concerns an opt-out customers revocation of its decision to opt-out. Ameren Missouri and KCP&L and GMO propose that program year be changed to calendar year. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will adopt the proposed change. 
COMMENT #61: The National Housing Trusts supports the updated language in subsection (8)(A) regarding state tax credit recipients. 
RESPONSE: The commission thanks the National Housing Trust for its comment. However, SB112, which was passed in the last legisla- tive session, eliminated the statutory language regarding state tax credit recipients. As a result, all of subsections (8)(A) and (B) must be eliminated as contrary to the revised statute. If SB112 is vetoed and does not become law, the subsections merely repeat the statute and are not necessary. The remaining subsection will be renumbered accordingly. 
COMMENT #62: Subsection (8)(B) requires a utility to obtain an attestation from each customer who receives a monetary incentive to participates in a demand-side program. The customer must attest that the customer has not received a tax credit listed in subsection (8)(A), and must acknowledge that the penalty for providing false informa- tion is a class A misdemeanor. Ameren Missouri claims this require- ment is too difficult to fulfill and suggests that as an alternative, the utility put a notice of the tax credit restrictions in the Terms and Conditions of the application customers would submit to participate in the program. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Because of the passage of SB112, the entire subsection will be deleted. 
COMMENT #63: Section (9) requires the electric utilities and their stakeholders to form collaboratives to provide input on design, imple- mentation and review of demand-side programs and market potential studies. Ameren Missouri offers a general comment describing its con- cern that the primary responsibility for the collaboratives remain with the utility. 
RESPONSE: The commission agrees with Ameren Missouri. The utilities’ participation in MEEIA is voluntary, so the collaboratives must work with the utilities rather than attempt to dictate to them. 
COMMENT #64: Subsection (9)(B) requires electric utilities and their stakeholders to form a statewide collaborative to consider statewide issues and concerns. Renew Missouri and the National Housing Trust indicates their strong support for the strengthening of the statewide collaborative. The Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance also supports the strengthening of the statewide collaborative. It does not suggest any specific changes to the proposed amendment, but offers several suggestions on ways the workings of the collaborative can be improved. 
RESPONSE: The commission agrees the statewide collaborative can be a useful tool. The rule can provide a framework for the operations of that collaborative. The specific suggestions on how the collabora- tive is to function are best addressed by the collaborative as circum- stances develop rather than being rigidly established in the text of the rule. 
COMMENT #65: Subparagraph (9)(B)1.A. directs the statewide col- laborative to create and implement statewide protocols for evaluation, measurement, and verification to energy efficiency savings by July 1, 2018. Staff recommends a grammatical correction. Ameren Missouri would revise the subparagraph to recognize that utility participation in MEEIA is optional and that no statewide protocol can be forced on the utilities. Public Counsel would delete this subparagraph entire- ly, arguing that current EM&V practices vary widely between utili- ties depending upon whether it has deployed AMI. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: While EM&V practices may vary widely at this time, the development of statewide protocols can still be helpful. Ameren Missouri is correct that the idea that the statewide collaborative can implement statewide proto- cols implies the collaborative has more authority than it does. The commission will change “create and implement statewide protocols” to “develop statewide protocols” in recognition that the statewide collaborative does not have authority to dictate to the electric utilities. Because the effective date of these rules has been delayed, the com- mission will change the due date for statewide protocols to December 31, 2018.

COMMENT #66: Subparagraph (9)(B)1.D. directs the statewide col- laborative to explore other opportunities, such as development of a percentage adder for non-energy benefits. Staff urges the commission to delete the direction to pursue the development of a percentage adder. Public Counsel would delete the entire subparagraph because it believes consideration of non-energy benefits is beyond the scope of the MEEIA statute. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with staff that the general direction to the statewide col- laborative to explore other opportunities is sufficient. There is no need to specify the possible development of a percentage adder. The commission will adopt the change proposed by staff. 
COMMENT #67: Paragraph (9)(B)3. directs the statewide collabo- rative to create a semi-annual forum for discussion of statewide pol- icy issues. The NRDC would require those forums to be held quar- terly. 
RESPONSE: The commission believes mandating two (2) forums per year is sufficient. If the statewide collaborative decides that more frequent forums are needed it is free to schedule as many as it likes. 
COMMENT #68: Section (10) concerns a statewide technical refer- ence manual, a TRM. Public Counsel suggests the entire section be deleted as a statewide TRM is no longer needed in the current regu- latory, policy and technological environment. The National Housing Trust expresses strong support for the statewide TRM. RESPONSE: The commission believes a statewide TRM still has value and will not delete the section. 
COMMENT #69: Subsection (10)(A) directs utilities and stakehold- ers to create and implement a statewide TRM. Staff suggests this subsection be deleted as the statewide TRM has already been devel- oped. KCP&L and GMO suggest a sentence be added to the end of the subsection to require that deemed values be used in calculations. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The statewide TRM now exists and the direction to create it is unnecessary. The commission will delete the subsection and renumber the remaining subsections. 
COMMENT #70: Paragraph (10)(B)2. indicates what is to be done if the commission rejects the proposed statewide TRM. Staff propos- es changes to the paragraph to emphasize the responsibility of stake- holders to develop solutions to the problems that led the commission to reject the proposed statewide TRM. KCP&L and GMO would change “shall” to “may” to recognize that the stakeholders may decide they no longer want to submit a statewide TRM if the one (1) they proposed is rejected by the commission. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The changes proposed by staff, as well as that proposed by KCP&L and GMO, help to clarify the paragraph. Both will be adopted. 
COMMENT #71: Subsection (10)(C) concerns the creation of an electronic platform to facilitate updates of the statewide TRM. Ameren Missouri proposes a change that would allow the commis- sion to direct the statewide collaborative to begin the process of securing a vendor to provide that electronic platform. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Ameren Missouri’s proposal to allow the commission to further involve the statewide collaborative in the development of the electronic platform will not be adopted because the vendor must be hired through a state contract, with an RFP initiated by the commission. 
COMMENT #72: Paragraph (10)(C)1. addresses the funding for the electronic platform authorized by this section. The Division of Energy proposes to modify this paragraph by exempting investor- owned utilities from the assessment if the statewide TRM does not include any measures that apply to that utility. 
RESPONSE: The Division of Energy’s proposal would needlessly complicate the funding provision and will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #73: The Division of Energy recommends the creation of a new paragraph (10)(C)2. that would direct the statewide collab- orative to recommend the amount of funding to be provided for the electronic platform and annual updates. 
RESPONSE: The commission is open to suggestions from the statewide collaborative, but is unwilling to relinquish control over its budgeting decisions. The Division of Energy’s proposal to further involve the collaborative will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #74: KCP&L and GMO recommend the creation of a new paragraph that would say “use of the TRM is limited to funding participants.” RESPONSE: The proposed statement is vague and unenforceable. The commission can certainly determine how it uses the TRM and how it can be applied to the utilities it regulates, but it cannot control how others may choose to use the TRM. The proposed change will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #75: Subsection (10)(D) concerns the annual updates of the statewide TRM. Ameren Missouri proposes the firm date of December 31 of each year be replaced with a more flexible require- ment that the update occur annually. The process and schedule for the update would then be developed through the statewide collabora- tive process. 
RESPONSE: The commission believes a firm date of December 31 each year is appropriate. If that date does not work, a variance from the rule may be requested. 
COMMENT #76: The Division of Energy and staff propose the same change to paragraph (10)(D)1., to emphasize that staff will coordinate the annual update rather than perform that duty by itself. Ameren Missouri would go further and make the utilities responsible for the annual update through the statewide collaborative process. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will continue to coordinate the TRM process. The TRM con- tractor will likely facilitate the TRM update stakeholder meetings. The change proposed by staff will be adopted, but Ameren Missouri’s change will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #77: Ameren Missouri proposes a change to subpara- graph (10)(D)1.A. The proposed subparagraph requires staff to con- vene stakeholder meetings no later than July 1 of each year to seek input on revisions to the TRM. Ameren Missouri would modify the requirement to remove the firm deadline to allow the utilities, rather than staff, to convene one (1) or more stakeholder meetings. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion will retain the authority to convene stakeholder meetings. Ameren Missouri’s proposed change will not be adopted. 
COMMENT #78: Paragraph (10)(D)2. concerns the submission of proposed annual updates to the statewide TRM and the commission’s approval or rejection of those updates. Ameren Missouri would remove the firm September 1 deadline from the rule consistent with its earlier comments. The Division of Energy would create a detailed process by which the commission or a designated regulatory law judge could consider proposed annual update changes. Staff suggests changes to emphasize the responsibility of stakeholders to propose solutions to problems identified by the commission. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The detailed procedures proposed by the Division of Energy are already available to the commission and do not need to be included in the rule. The September 1 deadline will remain in the rule, a variance can be requested if necessary. Staff’s changes will be adopted. 
COMMENT #79: Subsection (10)(E) allows the commission to con- sider the appropriateness of using an approved statewide TRM in each utility’s application for approval of demand-side programs. The Division of Energy would expand that provision to reference addition,

modification, or continuance of demand-side programs or measures. RESPONSE: The clarification proposed by the Division of Energy is unnecessary and will not be adopted. 
4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand-Side Programs 
(1) The definitions of terms used in this section can be found in 4 CSR 240-20.092 Definitions for Demand-Side Programs and Demand-Side Programs Investment Mechanisms. 
(2) Guideline to Review Progress Toward an Expectation that the Electric Utility’s Demand-Side Programs Can Achieve a Goal of All Cost-Effective Demand-Side Savings. The goals established in this section are not mandatory and no penalty or adverse consequence will accrue to a utility that is unable to achieve the listed annual ener- gy and demand savings goals. 
(A) The commission shall use the greater of the annual realistic amount of achievable energy savings and demand savings as deter- mined through a market potential study or the following incremental annual demand-side savings goals as a guideline to review and deter- mine whether the utility’s demand-side programs can achieve a goal of all cost-effective demand-side savings: 
1. For the utility’s approved first program year: three-tenths per- cent (0.3%) of total annual energy and one percent (1.0%) of annual peak demand; 
of annual peak demand; 5. For the utility’s approved fifth program year: three-and-five- 
tenths percent (3.5%) of total annual energy and five percent (5.0%) of annual peak demand; 
6. For the utility’s approved sixth program year: four-and-eight- tenths percent (4.8%) of total annual energy and six percent (6.0%) of annual peak demand; 
7. For the utility’s approved seventh program year: six-and- three-tenths percent (6.3%) of total annual energy and seven percent (7.0%) of annual peak demand; 
8. For the utility’s approved eighth program year: eight percent (8.0%) of total annual energy and eight percent (8.0%) of annual peak demand; and 
9. For the utility’s approved ninth year and subsequent program years, unless additional energy savings and demand savings goals are established by the commission: nine-and-nine-tenths percent (9.9%) of total annual energy and nine percent (9.0%) of annual peak demand for the approved ninth year, and then increasing by one-and- nine-tenths percent (1.9%) of total annual energy and by one percent (1.0%) of annual peak demand each year thereafter. 
(3) Utility Market Potential Studies. (A) The market potential study shall— 
1. Consider both primary data and secondary data and analysis for the utility’s service territory; 
2. Be updated with primary data and analysis no less frequently than every three (3) years. To the extent that primary data for each utility service territory is unavailable or insufficient, the market potential study may also rely on or be supplemented by data from secondary sources and relevant data from other geographic regions; 
3. Be prepared by an independent third party. The utility shall provide oversight and guidance to the independent market potential contractor, but shall not influence the independent market potential study contractor’s reports; and 
4. Include an estimate of the achievable potential, regardless of cost-effectiveness, of energy savings from low-income demand-side programs. Energy savings from multifamily buildings that house low- income households may count toward this target. 
(4) Applications for Approval of Electric Utility Demand-Side Programs or Portfolio. Pursuant to the provisions of this rule, 4 CSR 240-2.060, and section 393.1075, RSMo, an electric utility may file an application with the commission for approval of a demand-side portfolio. 
(B) As part of its application for approval of demand-side pro- grams, the electric utility shall file or provide a reference to the com- mission case that contains any of the following information. All mod- els and spreadsheets shall be provided as executable versions in native format with all links and formulas intact: 
1. A current market potential study. If the market potential study of the electric utility that is filing for approval of demand-side pro- grams or a demand-side portfolio encompasses more than just the utility’s service territory, the sampling methodology shall reflect the utility’s service territory and shall provide statistically significant results for that utility: 
A. Complete documentation of all assumptions, definitions, methodologies, sampling techniques, and other aspects of the current market potential study; 
B. Clear description of the process used to identify the broad- est possible list of measures and groups of measures for considera- tion; 
2. Clear description of the process and assumptions used to determine technical potential, economic potential, maximum achiev- able potential, and realistic achievable potential for a twenty- (20-) year planning horizon for major end-use groups (e.g., lighting, space heating, space cooling, refrigeration, motor drives, etc.) for each customer class; and 
3. Identification and discussion of the twenty- (20-) year base- line energy and demand forecasts. If the baseline energy and demand

3. For the utility’s percent (0.7%) of total annual peak demand; 
4. For the utility’s percent (0.9%) of total annual peak demand; 
5. For the utility’s tenth percent (1.1%) of total annual energy and one percent (1.0%) of annual peak demand; 
6. For the utility’s approved sixth program year: one-and-three- tenths percent (1.3%) of total annual energy and one percent (1.0%) of annual peak demand; 
7. For the utility’s approved seventh program year: one-and- five-tenths percent (1.5%) of total annual energy and one percent (1.0%) of annual peak demand; 
8. For the utility’s approved eighth program year: one-and- seven-tenths percent (1.7%) of total annual energy and one percent (1.0%) of annual peak demand; and 
9. For the utility’s approved ninth and subsequent program years, unless additional energy savings and demand savings goals are established by the commission: one-and-nine-tenths percent (1.9%) of total annual energy and one percent (1.0%) of annual peak demand each year. 
(B) The commission shall also use the greater of the cumulative annual realistic amount of achievable energy savings and demand sav- ings as determined through a market potential study or the following cumulative demand-side savings goals as a guideline to review and determine whether the utility’s demand-side programs can achieve a goal of all cost-effective demand-side savings: 
1. For the utility’s approved first program year: three-tenths per- cent (0.3%) of total annual energy and one percent (1.0%) of annual peak demand; 
2. For the utility’s approved second program year: eight-tenths percent (0.8%) of total annual energy and two percent (2.0%) of annual peak demand; 
3. For the utility’s approved third program year: one-and-five- tenths percent (1.5%) of total annual energy and three percent (3.0%) of annual peak demand; 
4. For the utility’s approved fourth program year: two-and-four- tenths percent (2.4%) of total annual energy and four percent (4.0%) 
approved second program year: five-tenths annual energy and one percent (1.0%) of 
approved third program year: seven-tenths annual energy and one percent (1.0%) of 
approved fourth program year: nine-tenths annual energy and one percent (1.0%) of 
approved fifth program year: one-and-one-

forecasts in the current market potential study differ from the base- line forecasts in the utility’s most recent 4 CSR 240-22 triennial com- pliance filing, the current market potential study shall provide a com- parison of the two (2) sets of forecasts and a discussion of the reasons for any differences between the two (2) sets of forecasts. The twen- ty- (20-) year baseline energy and demand forecasts shall account for the following: 
A. Discussion of the treatment of all of the utility’s customers who have opted out; 
B. Future changes in building codes and/or appliance effi- ciency standards; 
C. Changes in naturally occurring customer combined heat and power applications; 
D. Third party and other naturally occurring demand-side savings; and 
E. The increasing efficiency of advanced technologies. (C) Demonstration of cost-effectiveness for each demand-side pro- gram and for the total of all demand-side programs of the utility. At a minimum, the electric utility shall provide all workpapers, with all models and spreadsheets provided as executable versions in native 
format with all links and formulas intact, and include: 1. The total resource cost (TRC) test and a detailed description of the utility’s avoided costs calculations and all assumptions used in 
the calculation; 2. The utility shall also include calculations for the utility cost 
test, the participant test, the RIM test, and the societal cost test; 3. The impacts on annual revenue requirements and net present value of annual revenue requirements as a result of the integration analysis in accordance with 4 CSR 240-22.060 over the twenty- (20-) 
year planning horizon; and 4. The impacts from all demand-side programs included in the 
application on any postponement of new supply-side resources and the early retirement of existing supply-side resources, including annual and net present value of any lost utility earnings related there- to. 
(D) Detailed description of each proposed demand-side program, including all workpapers with all models and spreadsheets provided as executable versions in native format with all links and formulas intact, to include at least: 
1. Customers targeted; 2. Measures and services included; 3. Customer incentives ranges; 4. Proposed promotional techniques; 5. Specification of whether the demand-side program will be 
administered by the utility or a contractor; 6. Projected gross and net annual and lifetime energy savings; 7. Proposed energy savings targets; 8. Projected gross and net annual demand savings; 9. Proposed demand savings targets; 10. Net-to-gross factors; 11. Size of the potential market and projected penetration rates; 12. Any market transformation elements included in the 
demand-side program and an evaluation, measurement, and verifica- tion (EM&V) plan for estimating, measuring, and verifying the ener- gy and demand savings that the market transformation efforts are expected to achieve; 
13. EM&V plan including at least the proposed evaluation schedule and the proposed approach to achieving the evaluation goals pursuant to 4 CSR 240-20.093(7); 
14. Budget information in the following categories: A. Administrative costs listed separately for the utility and/or 
program administrator; B. Demand-side program incentive costs; C. Estimated equipment and installation costs, including any 
customer contributions; D. EM&V costs; and 
E. Miscellaneous itemized costs, some of which may be an allocation of total costs for overhead items such as the market poten- 
tial study or the statewide technical reference manual; 15. Description of all strategies used to minimize free riders; 16. Description of all strategies used to maximize spillover; and 17. For demand-side program plans, the proposed implementa- 
tion schedule of individual demand-side programs. (G) Designation of Program Pilots. For demand-side programs 
designed to operate on a limited basis for evaluation purposes before full implementation (program pilot), the utility shall provide as much of the information required under subsections (2)(C) through (E) of this rule as is practical and shall include explicit questions that the program pilot will address, the means and methods by which the util- ity proposes to address the questions the program pilot is designed to address, a provisional cost-effectiveness evaluation if the program is subject to a cost-effectiveness test under section 393.1075.4, RSMo, the proposed geographic area, and duration for the program pilot. 
(H) Any existing demand-side program with tariff sheets in effect prior to the effective date of this rule shall be included in the initial application for approval of demand-side programs if the utility intends for unrecovered and/or new costs related to the existing demand-side program be included in the DSIM. The commission shall approve, approve with modification acceptable to the electric utility, or reject such applications for approval of demand-side pro- gram plans within one hundred twenty (120) days of the filing of an application under this section only after providing the opportunity for a hearing. In the case of a utility filing an application for approval of an individual demand-side program, the commission shall approve, approve with modification acceptable to the electric utility, or reject applications within sixty (60) days of the filing of an application under this section only after providing the opportunity for a hearing. 
(I) The commission shall consider the TRC test a preferred cost- effectiveness test. For demand-side programs and program plans that have a TRC test ratio greater than one (1), the commission shall approve demand-side programs or program plans, budgets, and demand and energy savings targets for each demand-side program it approves, provided it finds that the utility has met the filing and sub- mission requirements of this rule and the demand-side programs— 
1. Are consistent with a goal of achieving all cost-effective demand-side savings; 
2. Have reliable evaluation, measurement, and verification plans; and 
3. Are included in the electric utility’s preferred plan or have been analyzed through the integration process required by 4 CSR 240-22.060 to determine the impact of the demand-side programs and program plans on the net present value of revenue requirements of the electric utility. 
(J) The commission shall approve demand-side programs targeted to low-income customers or general education campaigns, if the commission determines that the utility has met the filing and submis- sion requirements of this rule, the demand-side programs are in the public interest, and the demand-side programs meet the requirements stated in subsection (4)(I). If a demand-side program is targeted to low-income customers, the electric utility must also state how the electric utility will assess the expected and actual effect of the demand-side program on the utility’s bad debt expenses, customer arrearages, and disconnections. 
(K) The commission shall approve demand-side programs which have a TRC test ratio less than one (1), if the commission finds the utility has met the filing and submission requirements of this rule and the costs of such demand-side programs above the level determined to be cost-effective are funded by the customers participating in the demand-side programs or through tax or other governmental credits or incentives specifically designed for that purpose and meet the requirements as stated in subsection (4)(I). 
(5) Applications for Approval of Modifications to Electric Utility Demand-Side Programs. 
(A) Pursuant to the provisions of this rule, 4 CSR 240-2.060, and section 393.1075, RSMo, an electric utility—

Missouri Register 
Page 1269 

1. Shall file an application with the commission for modification of demand-side programs when there is a variance of twenty percent (20%) or more in the budget approved by the commission under sub- section (4)(I) or other commission order(s) and/or any demand-side program design modification which is no longer covered by the approved tariff sheets for the demand-side program; 
2. The application shall include a complete, reasonably detailed, explanation for and documentation of the proposed modifications to each of the filing requirements in section (3). All models and spread- sheets shall be provided as executable versions in native format with all links and formulas intact; 
3. The electric utility shall serve a copy of its application to all parties to the case under which the demand-side programs were approved; 
4. The parties shall have thirty (30) days from the date of filing of an application to object to the application to modify; 
5. If no objection is raised within thirty (30) days, the commis- sion shall approve, approve with modification acceptable to the elec- tric utility, or reject such applications for approval of modification of demand-side programs within forty-five (45) days of the filing of an application under this section, subject to the same guidelines as established in subsection (4)(I); 
6. If objections to the application are raised, the commission shall provide the opportunity for a hearing. 
(B) For any demand-side program design modifications approved by the commission, the utility shall file for and receive approval of associated tariff sheets prior to implementation of approved modifi- cations. 
(6) Applications for Approval to Discontinue Electric Utility Demand- Side Programs. Pursuant to the provisions of this rule, 4 CSR 240- 2.060, and section 393.1075, RSMo, an electric utility may file an application with the commission to discontinue demand-side pro- grams. 
(A) The application shall include the following information. All models and spreadsheets shall be provided as executable versions in native format with all links and formulas intact. 
1. Complete, reasonably detailed explanation for the utility’s decision to request to discontinue a demand-side program. 
2. EM&V reports for the demand-side program in question, if available. 
3. Date by which a final EM&V report for the demand-side pro- gram in question will be filed. 
(B) If the TRC calculated for a demand-side program not targeted to low-income customers or a general education campaign is not cost- effective, the electric utility shall identify the causes why and present possible demand-side program modifications that could make the demand-side program cost-effective. If analysis of these modified demand-side program designs suggests that none would be cost- effective, the demand-side program may be discontinued. In this case, the utility shall describe how it intends to end the demand-side program and how it intends to achieve the energy and demand savings initially estimated for the discontinued demand-side program. Nothing herein requires utilities to end any demand-side program which is subject to a cost-effectiveness test deemed not cost-effective immediately. Utilities proposal for any discontinuation of a demand- side program should consider, but not be limited to: the potential impact on the market for energy efficiency services in its territory; the potential impact to vendors and the utilities relationship with ven- dors; the potential disruption to the market and to customer outreach efforts from immediate starting and stopping of demand-side pro- grams; and whether the long term prospects indicate that continued pursuit of a demand-side program will result in a long-term cost- effective benefit to ratepayers. 
(C) The commission shall approve or reject such applications for discontinuation of utility demand-side programs within thirty (30) days of the filing of an application under this section only after pro- viding an opportunity for a hearing. 
(7) Provisions for Customers to Opt-Out of Participation in Utility Demand-Side Programs. 
(A) Any customer meeting one (1) or more of the following crite- ria shall be eligible to opt-out of participation in utility-offered demand-side programs: 
1. The customer has one (1) or more accounts within the service territory of the electric utility that has a demand of five thousand (5,000) kW or more; 
2. The customer operates an interstate pipeline pumping station, regardless of size; or 
3. The customer has accounts within the service territory of the electric utility that have, in aggregate across its accounts, a coinci- dent demand of two thousand five hundred (2,500) kW or more in the previous twelve (12) months, and the customer has a comprehen- sive demand-side or energy efficiency program and can demonstrate an achievement of savings at least equal to those expected from util- ity-provided demand-side programs. The customer shall submit to commission staff sufficient documentation to demonstrate compli- ance with these criteria, including, but not limited to: 
A. Lists of all energy efficiency measures with work papers to show energy savings and demand savings. This can include engi- neering studies, cost benefit analysis, etc.; 
B. Documentation of anticipated lifetime of installed energy efficiency measures; 
C. Invoices and payment requisition papers; (B) For utilities with automated meter reading and/or advanced 
metering infrastructure capability, the measure of demand is the cus- tomer coincident highest billing demand of the individual accounts during the twelve (12) months preceding the opt-out notification. 
(C) Any confidential business information submitted as documen- tation shall be clearly designated as such in accordance with 4 CSR 240-2.135. 
(D) Opt-out in accordance with paragraphs (7)(A)1., 2., and 3. shall be in effect for ten years, beginning with the calendar year sub- sequent to the submission of the opt-out. 
(E) Written notification of opt-out from customers meeting the cri- teria under paragraph (7)(A)1. or 2. shall be sent to the utility serv- ing the customer. Written notification of opt-out from customers meeting the criteria under paragraph (7)(A)3. shall be sent to the util- ity serving the customer and the manager of the energy resources department of the commission or submitted through the commis- sion’s electronic filing and information system (EFIS) as a non-case- related filing. In instances where only the utility is provided notifica- tion of opt-out from customers meeting the criteria under paragraph (7)(A)3., the utility shall forward a copy of the written notification to the manager of the energy resources department of the commission and submit the notice of opt-out through EFIS as a non-case-related filing. 
(F) Written notification of opt-out from customer shall include at a minimum: 
1. Customer’s legal name; 
2. Identification of location(s) and utility account number(s) of accounts for which the customer is requesting to opt-out from demand-side program’s benefits and costs; and 
3. Demonstration that the customer qualifies for opt-out. (G) For customers filing notification of opt-out under paragraph (7)(A)1. or 2., notification of the utility’s acknowledgement or plan to dispute a customer’s notification to opt-out of participation in demand-side programs shall be delivered in writing to the customer and to the staff within thirty (30) days of when the utility received the 
written notification of opt-out from the customer. (H) For customers filing notification of opt-out under paragraph 
(7)(A)3., the staff will make the determination of whether the cus- tomer meets the criteria of paragraph (7)(A)3. Notification of the staff’s acknowledgement or disagreement with customer’s qualifica- tion to opt-out of participation in demand-side programs shall be delivered to the customer and to the utility within thirty (30) days of when the staff received complete documentation of compliance with paragraph (7)(A)3.

Orders of Rulemaking 

(I) Timing and Effect of Opt-Out Provisions. 1. A customer notice of opt-out shall be received by the utility 
no earlier than September 1 and not later than October 30 to be effective for the following calendar year. 
2. For that calendar year in which the customer receives acknowledgement of opt-out and each successive calendar year until the customer revokes the notice pursuant to subsection (7)(K), or the customer is notified that it no longer satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (7)(A)1., 2., or 3., none of the costs of approved demand-side programs of an electric utility offered pursuant to 4 CSR 240-20.093, 4 CSR 240-20.094, or by other authority and no other charges implemented in accordance with section 393.1075, RSMo, shall be assigned to any account of the customer, including its affiliates and subsidiaries listed on the customer’s written notifi- cation of opt-out. 
(J) Dispute Notices. If the utility or staff provides notice that a customer does not meet the opt-out criteria to qualify for opt-out or renewal of opt-out, the customer may file a complaint with the com- mission. The commission shall provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing to resolve any dispute. 
(K) Revocation.
