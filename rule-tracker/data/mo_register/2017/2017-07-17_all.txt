Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 15—ELECTED OFFICIALS Division 40—State Auditor Chapter 3—Rules Applying to Political Subdivisions 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 
15 CSR 40-3.170 Addendum Filed with the Auditor’s Office. The State Auditor’s office is amending section (1), adding new section (7), renumbering section (7) to section (8), adding subsection (8)(D), and replacing the form Office of the State Auditor Addendum. 
PURPOSE: This amendment sets forth the procedure for a county, city, town, or village to provide the information required by section 479.359 of Conference Committee Substitute No. 2 for House Committee Substitute for Senate Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 572, Second Regular Session, Ninety-eighth General Assembly. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 5, First Regular Session, Ninety- eighth General Assembly, went into effect on August 28, 2015. Section 479.359.4 in SB 5 specified, “On or before December 31, 2015, the state auditor shall set forth by rule a procedure for includ- ing the addendum information required by this section.” In compli- ance with this section, the State Auditor’s office filed a proposed rule, which became effective on March 30, 2016, and an emergency rule, which became effective December 10, 2015. This rule set forth the 
procedure for a county, city, town, or village with a municipal court to provide the information required by section 479.359, RSMo, and to certify that it is in substantial compliance with the municipal court procedures specified in SB 5. On March 28, 2016, the Circuit Court of Cole County in the case of City of Normandy v. Jeremiah Nixon, No. 15AC-CC00531, held that certain sections of SB 5, including sec- tion 479.359.3, RSMo, violated the Missouri Constitution (special laws that violated Article III, Section 40 and unfunded mandates that violated Article I, Sections 16 and 20) and enjoined the state from enforcing these provisions. This case was appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court. 
Subsequently, Conference Committee Substitute No. 2 for House Committee Substitute for Senate Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 572, Second Regular Session, Ninety-eighth General Assembly, was passed to be effective August 28, 2016. SB 572 does not require that every county, city, town, or village submit an addendum to its annual financial report containing an accounting of its total revenues from minor traffic violations as a percentage of its annual general operating revenue. SB 572 provides that “An addendum to the annual financial report submitted to the state auditor under sec- tion 105.145 by the county, city, town, or village that has chosen to have a municipal court division shall contain an accounting of . . . (2) The total revenues from fines, bond forfeitures, and court costs for municipal ordinance violations and minor traffic violations occurring within the county, city, town, or village, including amended charges from any municipal ordinance violations and minor traffic violations; (3) The percent of annual general operating revenues from fines, bond forfeitures, and court costs for municipal ordinance violations and minor traffic violations occurring within the county, city, town, or vil- lage, including amended charges from any charged municipal ordi- nance violations and minor traffic violations, charged in the municipal court of that county, city, town, or village.” 
On May 15, 2017, the Missouri Supreme Court in City of Normandy v. Greitens, SC95624, reversed the decision of the Circuit Court of Cole County and upheld the provisions of section 479.359, RSMo. 
As a result of the Missouri Supreme Court’s decision, the State Auditor’s office determined that this emergency amendment is neces- sary to preserve a compelling governmental interest in ensuring every county, city, town, or village that has chosen to have a municipal court division shall have notice of the information it must file with the State Auditor’s office as required by section 479.359 in SB 572. The State Auditor’s office believes this emergency amendment is fair to all interested persons and parties under these circumstances. The scope of this emergency amendment is limited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. This emergency amend- ment was filed June 13, 2017, becomes effective June 26, 2017, and expires December 22, 2017. 
(1) Every county, city, town, or village that has chosen to have a municipal court division shall annually file with the State Auditor’s Office a completed form, which is included herein, and available on the State Auditor’s website, and contains, at a minimum, the follow- ing: 
(C) The total revenue from fines, bond forfeitures, and court costs for municipal ordinance violations and minor traffic violations occurring within the county, city, town, or village based on the defi- nitions in section 479.350, RSMo, including amended charges for any municipal ordinance violations and minor traffic violations; and 
(D) The percent of annual general operating revenue from fines, bond forfeitures, and court costs for municipal ordinance violations and minor traffic violations as defined by section 479.350, RSMo, including amended charges for any municipal ordinance violations and minor traffic violation.

Emergency Rules 

(7) If a county, city, town, or village’s total gross revenue from the operation of its municipal court, including all fees, fines, bond forfeitures, and court costs retained by the county, city, town, or village from any case heard in its municipal court, is less than the statutory percentage of annual general operating revenue over which the proceeds must be distributed to the schools annually as provided by section 479.359, RSMo, the county, city, town, or vil- lage may report its total gross revenue from the operation of its municipal court in lieu of reporting its total revenue from fines, bond forfeitures, and court costs for municipal ordinance viola- tions and minor traffic violations occurring within the county, city, town, or village. 
[(7)](8) Examples. (A) A city with a municipal court has several ordinances related to 
equipment failure, vehicle registration, and seatbelt use for which no points are placed on the driver’s license upon conviction. The funds received from these violations should be included in “minor traffic violations” when reporting the information under section (1) of this regulation because the statutory definition of “minor traffic viola- tion” includes municipal or county ordinance traffic violations, except those that involve authorization for the Department of Revenue to assess five (5) or more points to a person’s driving record upon conviction, assuming that the specific violation does not fall within one (1) of the other statutorily enumerated exceptions in the definition of “minor traffic violation.” 
(B) The municipal court amends a violation that does not meet the definition of “minor traffic violation” to a violation that does meet this definition. The funds received from these violations should be included in “minor traffic violations” when reporting the information under section (1) of this regulation because the calculation includes charges for all minor traffic violations. 
(C) The municipal court amends a violation that meets the defini- tion of “minor traffic violation” to a violation that does not meet this definition. The funds received from these violations should be included in “minor traffic violations” when reporting the information under section (1) of this regulation because the original charge is a minor traffic violation. 
(D) All ordinance violations for a city are adjudicated in a municipal court division operated by another political jurisdic- tion and not by that city. Because the city does not operate its own municipal court division, it does not need to file an adden- dum with its financial report filed under the procedures in 15 CSR 40-3.030.

Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]

AUTHORITY: sections 590.030.5(1), 590.050, and 590.190, RSMo [Supp. 2013] 2016. Original rule filed May 1, 2002, effective Oct. 30, 2002. Amended: Filed July 1, 2008, effective Dec. 30, 2008. Amended: Filed Dec. 3, 2015, effective May 30, 2016. Amended: Filed June 12, 2017.

Title 15—ELECTED OFFICIALS Division 40—State Auditor Chapter 3—Rules Applying to Political Subdivisions 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
15 CSR 40-3.170 Addendum Filed with the Auditor’s Office. The State Auditor’s office is amending section (1), adding new section (7), renumbering section (7) to section (8), adding subsection (8)(D), and replacing the form Office of the State Auditor Addendum. 
PURPOSE: This amendment sets forth the procedure for a county, city, town, or village to provide the information required by section 479.359 of Conference Committee Substitute No. 2 for House Committee Substitute for Senate Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 572, Second Regular Session, Ninety-eighth General Assembly. 
(1) Every county, city, town, or village that has chosen to have a municipal court division shall annually file with the State Auditor’s Office a completed form, which is included herein, and available on the State Auditor’s website, and contains, at a minimum, the follow- ing: 
(C) The total revenue from fines, bond forfeitures, and court costs for municipal ordinance violations and minor traffic violations occurring within the county, city, town, or village based on the def- initions in section 479.350, RSMo, including amended charges for any municipal ordinance violations and minor traffic violations; and 
(D) The percent of annual general operating revenue from fines, bond forfeitures, and court costs for municipal ordinance violations and minor traffic violations as defined by section 479.350, RSMo, including amended charges for any municipal ordinance violations and minor traffic violation. 
(7) If a county, city, town, or village’s total gross revenue from the operation of its municipal court, including all fees, fines, bond forfeitures, and court costs retained by the county, city, town, or village from any case heard in its municipal court, is less than the statutory percentage of annual general operating rev- enue over which the proceeds must be distributed to the schools annually as provided by section 479.359, RSMo, the county, city, town, or village may report its total gross revenue from the oper- ation of its municipal court in lieu of reporting its total revenue from fines, bond forfeitures, and court costs for municipal ordi- nance violations and minor traffic violations occurring within the county, city, town, or village. 
[(7)](8) Examples. (A) A city with a municipal court has several ordinances related to 
equipment failure, vehicle registration, and seatbelt use for which no points are placed on the driver’s license upon conviction. The funds received from these violations should be included in “minor traffic violations” when reporting the information under section (1) of this regulation because the statutory definition of “minor traffic viola- tion” includes municipal or county ordinance traffic violations, except those that involve authorization for the Department of Revenue to assess five (5) or more points to a person’s driving record upon conviction, assuming that the specific violation does not fall within one (1) of the other statutorily enumerated exceptions in the definition of “minor traffic violation.” 
(B) The municipal court amends a violation that does not meet the definition of “minor traffic violation” to a violation that does meet this definition. The funds received from these violations should be included in “minor traffic violations” when reporting the information under section (1) of this regulation because the calculation includes charges for all minor traffic violations. 
(C) The municipal court amends a violation that meets the defin- ition of “minor traffic violation” to a violation that does not meet this definition. The funds received from these violations should be included in “minor traffic violations” when reporting the information under section (1) of this regulation because the original charge is a minor traffic violation. 
(D) All ordinance violations for a city are adjudicated in a municipal court division operated by another political jurisdic- tion and not by that city. Because the city does not operate its own municipal court division, it does not need to file an adden- dum with its financial report filed under the procedures in 15 CSR 40-3.030.
