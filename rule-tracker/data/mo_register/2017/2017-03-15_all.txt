Title 10—DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Division 20—Clean Water Commission Chapter 8—Design Guides 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Clean Water Commission under section 644.026, RSMo 2016, the Clean Water Commission amends a rule as follows: 
10 CSR 20–8.500 is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on September 1, 2016 (41 MoReg 1070–1077). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: A public hearing was held on the proposed amendment on October 5, 2016. The public comment peri- od ended on November 17, 2016. At the public hearing the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (department) staff explained the proposed amendment. Comments were provided by Robert Brundage (Newman, Comley & Ruth P.C., Missouri Agribusiness Assoc. (Mo- Ag)) and Josh Wilson (Cady Aquastore, Inc). 
COMMENT #1: Mo-Ag suggests the term “environment” be removed from section (2). There is no definition for “environment” within the statue or the regulation. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The words “to the environment” have been taken out of this rule. The reference to a discharge to the waters of the state is sufficient. 
COMMENT #2: Mo-Ag suggests that section (5) be revised to make clear that engineering reports are only required to be prepared when a construction permit is required. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Language was revised in section (5) to make it clear that engineering reports are required when facilities are submitting an application for a construc- tion permit. Engineering reports are recommended, but not required, for other changes not requiring a construction permit. 
COMMENT #3: Mo-Ag suggest an exemption to the requirement in subsection (3)(B) that a liner be installed under all liquid fertilizer tanks with a capacity of over forty thousand (40,000) gallons that existed prior to the new effective date of this rule. 
RESPONSE: This rule addresses all design and construction of facil- ities. Only tanks of this size constructed after January 13, 1992 would have been required to have secondary containment as outlined in the Secondary Containment rule that initially became effective on that date. The rule has not been changed. 
COMMENT #4: Mo-Ag suggested that the requirement in subsec- tion (9)(D) be changed to eliminate the requirement for immediate cleanup of spilled product and require cleanup on a daily basis or immediately after unloading occurs in the event precipitation in the area is likely. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The require- ment for immediate cleanup of spills of dry fertilizer and pesticides has been removed from this amendment. This is an operational requirement and daily cleanup is required as stated in the operating permit. 
COMMENT #5: MO-AG has concerns about any requirement to enclose the entire length of a conveyor or to require a concrete pad underneath the entire length of the conveyor. This comment applies to paragraphs (7)(C)7. and (7)(D)6. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The require- ment for a concrete pad under loading and unloading areas applies only to the areas at the actual transfer points. It was not the depart- ment’s intent to require enclosing the entire conveyor or having a pad extend below all of the exterior portions of a conveyance system. Language in section (7) has been clarified so that mixing and loading pads are required only under exterior transfer points. 
COMMENT #6: Mo-Ag suggested that the reference to “to humans or” in section (12) be removed as human safety is not under the juris- diction of MDNR. RESPONSE: The department believes that safety must be inherent in engineering designs for the protection of the human environment. No change has been made to this section. 
COMMENT #7: Mo-Ag requested a definition for “modification” be added to this rule, and provided several examples of projects with questions about applicability. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: This rule applies to the construction of containment systems at new facilities. It also applies when new containment systems are being constructed at existing facilities and when existing containment systems are being replaced. It applies to all new construction or replacements. The rule does not apply to existing containment systems if they are being retained and will not be modified. For instance, if the scope of a pro- ject is limited to the replacement of a certain containment system, say a replacement tank or conveyor, the rule would only apply to that individual piece of equipment. To clarify rule applicability, minor changes to language in sections (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (14), and (15) have been made to eliminate the reference to “modifications.” 
COMMENT #8: Mo-Ag requested a clarification to the intent of

Orders of Rulemaking 

section (7). Their interpretation is that it allows facilities to discharge stormwater from secondary and primary containments so long as spilled product is properly cleaned up and/or recovered prior to dis- charge of any stormwater. 
RESPONSE: Stormwater discharges that will comply with the gen- eral permit for agrichemical facilities (MOR 240, modified September 1, 2016) and specifically with item 3 of the applicability section of the permit are allowed. Section (7) of the regulation serves to summarize the purpose of the design requirements for secondary and operational containment areas. They are used to prevent dis- charges of spilled products and contaminated stormwater until cleanup and recovery is complete. Stormwater discharges from these operation containment areas are allowed. This section has been mod- ified to clarify that these containment areas should be designed to contain any spilled product to prevent a discharge of water contami- nants. 
COMMENT #9: Mo-Ag suggests the rule state a specific effective date six (6) months after the rule becomes effective to address con- cerns about facilities that may have already been designed. RESPONSE: New design requirements will be effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations, which would occur about forty-five (45) days after the Clean Water Commission’s decision, so there should be adequate notice for changes. The depart- ment will consider justifiable deviations as the changes to this rule are not extensive. 
COMMENT #10: Josh Wilson, with Cady Aquastore, Inc., ques- tioned why the use of a liner as a primary containment for liquid fer- tilizer and the tank as the secondary containment was not added to the amendment. Several tank representatives had attended the public hearing and made this request. 
RESPONSE: This is outside of the scope of this rulemaking. This change can be considered in future revisions when the department has more experience with this type of construction. The department has reviewed two (2) projects that use liners as primary containment and they have been approved as deviations. Applications in the near future can be reviewed and approved in the same manner. 
10 CSR 20-8.500 Design Requirements for Agrichemical Facilities 
(2) General. A facility need only to comply with these rules when they come within the definition of an agrichemical facility. Any con- struction after the effective date of this rule shall be in compliance with all of these rules before the commencement of any operational activities or any storage or use of agrichemicals. Any existing agri- chemical facility that has a discharge of agrichemicals or process generated wastewater is required to take immediate steps to imple- ment the secondary and operational containment requirements con- tained in this rule in addition to any other remedy required. All new operations shall be designed to be no discharge. 
(5) Engineering Report. An engineering report is required for all facilities required to submit an application for a construction permit and is recommended for all facilities. The engineering report assem- bles basic information, presents design criteria and assumptions, examines alternate projects with preliminary layouts and cost esti- mates, offers a conclusion with a proposed project for client consid- eration, and outlines official actions and procedures to implement the project. Engineering reports shall contain the following information and other pertinent information and may be combined with other engineering documentation: 
(C) Existing conditions at the agrichemical facility and proposed construction at the facility shall be discussed; 
(6) Primary Containment for Bulk Agrichemicals for new construc- tion. Containers and appurtenances used as the primary containment in the storage and handling of bulk agrichemicals shall be construct- 
ed, installed, and maintained to prevent a discharge and shall be of materials and construction compatible with the specifications of the product stored. 
(7) Secondary Containment for Bulk Agrichemicals for new con- struction. Secondary containment for nonmobile bulk pesticides and nonmobile bulk fertilizers shall be designed to contain any spilled product to prevent a discharge. 
(C) Nonmobile Bulk Dry Fertilizer Storage. 1. Dry fertilizer shall be stored inside a sound structure to pre- 
vent contact with precipitation. All surface water runoff shall be diverted away from the storage structure. 
2. All unloading, loading, mixing, and handling of dry bulk fer- tilizers should be done on an operational containment area. 
3. Pesticide impregnation of dry fertilizer shall take place within an operational containment area adequate in size to hold the volume of pesticides used and impregnation equipment. 
4. Daily cleanup of the dry fertilizer loading, unloading, mix- ing, and handling areas shall take place. 
5. Whenever feasible, dry fertilizer spreading equipment should be cleaned in the field to minimize containment and disposal require- ments at the operational containment area. 
6. The floors of the bulk dry fertilizer storage area shall be paved with concrete or other approved materials that will prevent the downward movement of fertilizer materials and moisture through the floor. For concrete floors and walls, expansion joints shall be placed on a close enough spacing to prevent cracks from forming. The expansion joints shall be sealed with a material resistant to agrichem- icals. Cracks that occur in the floors and walls shall be sealed to pre- vent the downward or lateral movement of fertilizer materials and moisture. 
7. A mixing and loading pad shall be constructed under any exterior transfer area of a conveyance system. 
(D) Nonmobile Bulk Dry Pesticide Storage. 1. Dry pesticides shall be stored inside a sound structure to pre- 
vent contact with precipitation. All surface water runoff shall be diverted away from the storage structure. 
2. All loading, mixing, and handling of bulk dry pesticides should be done on an operational containment area. 
3. Daily cleanup of the bulk dry pesticide loading, unloading, mixing, and handling areas shall take place. 
4. Whenever feasible, bulk dry pesticide spreading equipment should be cleaned in the field to minimize containment and disposal requirements at the operational containment area. 
5. The floors of the bulk dry pesticide storage area shall be paved with concrete or other approved materials that will prevent the downward movement of pesticide materials and moisture through the floor. For concrete floors and walls, expansion joints shall be placed on a close enough spacing to prevent cracks from forming. The expansion joints shall be sealed with a material resistant to agrichem- icals. Cracks that occur in the floors and walls shall be sealed to pre- vent the downward or lateral movement of pesticide materials and moisture. 
6. A mixing and loading pad shall be constructed under any exterior transfer area of a conveyance system. 
(8) Operational Containment for bulk liquid pesticides and bulk liq- uid fertilizers for new construction. The operational containment area for bulk liquid pesticides and bulk liquid fertilizers shall be designed to contain any product discharged or collected precipitation for the amount of time required for proper cleanup and recovery. 
(9) Operational Containment Area for bulk dry pesticides and bulk dry fertilizers for new construction. The operational containment area for bulk dry pesticides and bulk dry fertilizers shall be sized and designed to contain any spillage or leakage of dry materials that occurs from the loading and unloading of hauling or spreading equip- ment and from the mixing and blending equipment or precipitation

that comes in contact with the operational containment area for the amount of time required for proper cleanup and recovery. 
(D) For unloading dry pesticides and dry fertilizers from rail cars, a catchment basin or concrete pad that can effectively contain the dry fertilizer or pesticide that may be discharged during the unloading process shall be used. 
(14) Plans. (A) General. All plans for primary, secondary, and operational 
containment structures for new construction at agrichemical facilities shall bear the name of the agrichemical facility and shall show the scale in feet, a graphic scale, the north point, date, and the name of the engineer, certificate number and imprint of his/her registration seal. The plans shall be clear and legible. They shall be drawn to a scale which will permit all necessary information to be plainly shown. The size of the plans generally should not be larger than thir- ty inches by forty-two inches (30" × 42") (76 cm × 107 cm). Datum used should be indicated. Locations and logs of test borings and when made shall be shown on the plans. Detail plans shall consist of plan views, elevations, sections, and supplementary views which, together with the specifications and general layouts, provide the working information for the contract and construction of the contain- ment facilities. Plans shall include dimensions and relative elevations of structures, the location and outline form of equipment, storage tanks, location and size of piping, and ground elevations. 
(B) Plans for new construction. 1. Location plan. A plan shall show the location of the agri-

SUMMARY: This notice publishes MoDOT’s receipt of applications for the issuance of Skill Performance Evaluation (SPE) Certificates from individuals who do not meet the physical qualification require- ments in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations for drivers of commercial motor vehicles in Missouri intrastate commerce because of impaired vision or an established medical history or clinical diag- nosis of diabetes mellitus currently requiring insulin for control. If granted, the SPE Certificates will authorize these individuals to qual- ify as drivers of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs), in intrastate commerce only, without meeting the vision standard prescribed in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(10), if applicable, or the diabetes standard prescribed in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(3).

Background 
The individuals listed in this notice have recently filed applications requesting MoDOT to issue SPE Certificates to exempt them from the physical qualification requirements relating to vision in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(10), or to diabetes in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(3), which other- wise apply to drivers of CMVs in Missouri intrastate commerce. 
Under section 622.555, RSMo, MoDOT may issue an SPE Certificate, for not more than a two- (2-) year period, if it finds that the applicant has the ability, while operating CMVs, to maintain a level of safety that is equivalent to or greater than the driver qualifi- cation standards of 49 CFR 391.41. Upon application, MoDOT may renew an exemption upon expiration. 
Accordingly, the agency will evaluate the qualifications of each appli- cant to determine whether issuing an SPE Certificate will comply with the statutory requirements and will achieve the required level of safety. If granted, the SPE Certificate is only applicable to intrastate transportation wholly within Missouri.
