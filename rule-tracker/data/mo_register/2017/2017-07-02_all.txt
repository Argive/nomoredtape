Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 6—DEPARTMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION Division 255—Fertilizer Control Board Chapter 1—Organization and Description 
EMERGENCY RULE 6 CSR 255-1.010 General Organization 
PURPOSE: The purpose of this rule is to comply with section 536.023, RSMo which requires each agency to adopt, as a rule, a description of its operation and the methods whereby the public may obtain information or make submissions or requests. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: This emergency rule is necessary to prevent a budget shortfall by the newly created Fertilizer Control Board. This rule increases the tonnage fee from the default thirty cents ($0.30) per ton to sixty cents ($0.60) per ton, establishes a fifty dollar ($50) minimum reporting fee, and allows for the continued col- lection of a permit fee. Senate Bill 655, Second Regular Session, 98th General Assembly, 2016 (SB655) amended the Missouri Fertilizer Law. The Missouri Fertilizer Law already allowed for collection of a tonnage fee from fertilizer distributors. 6 CSR 250-11.040, estab- lished by rule, set a tonnage fee of fifty cents ($0.50). SB655 amend- ed the Missouri Fertilizer Law and allows a tonnage fee of thirty cents to one dollar ($0.30 to $1.00) per ton, but in the absence of a rule, the tonnage fee drops from fifty cents to thirty cents ($0.50 to $0.30). 6 CSR 250-11.070, established by rule, set a permit fee from fertilizer distributors. But in the absence of a rule, the amended statute did not 
allow for collection of a permit fee. The reduced tonnage fee and the absence of a permit fee would result in a forty-five point eight percent (45.8%) loss in total revenue to administer the Missouri Fertilizer Law. This emergency rule is necessary to preserve a compelling gov- ernmental interest to ensure adequate funding to administer the requirements of the Missouri Fertilizer Law. A proposed rule, which covers the same material is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. The scope of this emergency rule is limited to circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The Fertilizer Control Board believes this emergency rule is fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency rule was filed May 24, 2017, becomes effective June 3, 2017, and expires November 29, 2017. 
(1) The Fertilizer Control Board was created by Senate Bill 655, Second Regular Session, 98th General Assembly, 2016. All fertilizer fees collected by the Director of the Agricultural Experiment Station (a unit of the University of Missouri) shall be utilized by the board. Board membership is determined by the by-laws of the board. The board shall— 
(A) Determine the method and amount of fees to be assessed; 
(B) Adopt, amend, promulgate, or repeal rules and regulations to administer, implement, and enforce the Missouri Fertilizer Law; 
(C) Exercise general supervision of the administration and enforce- ment of the Missouri Fertilizer Law; 
(D) Provide systems of registry, field inspections, laboratory analysis, penalty and enforcement procedures, and publications of results necessary to assure the quality of fertilizers offered for sale in this state; 
(E) Pursue research, educational, and outreach programs; and 
(F) Retain, employ, provide for, and compensate such consultants, assistants, and other employees on a full- or part-time basis and con- tract for goods and services as may be necessary. 
(2) For information concerning the Fertilizer Control Board and administration of the Missouri Fertilizer Law, the public may visit, or write to, 428 E. Capitol Street, Suite 303, Jefferson City, MO 65102 or call (573) 636-6131. 
AUTHORITY: sections 266.331 and 266.336, RSMo 2016. Emergency rule filed May 24, 2017, effective June 3, 2017, expires Nov. 29, 2017. A proposed rule covering this same material is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. 
Title 6—DEPARTMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION Division 255—Fertilizer Control Board Chapter 10—Administration of Missouri Fertilizer Law 
EMERGENCY RULE 6 CSR 255-10.010 Tonnage Fee 
PURPOSE: This rule sets forth the tonnage fee to be paid by fertilizer distributors. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: This emergency rule is necessary to pre- vent a budget shortfall by the newly created Fertilizer Control Board. This rule increases the tonnage fee from the default thirty cents ($0.30) per ton to sixty cents ($0.60) per ton, establishes a fifty dollar ($50) minimum reporting fee, and allows for the continued collection of a permit fee.

a tonnage fee of fifty cents ($0.50). SB655 amended the Missouri Fertilizer Law and allows a tonnage fee of thirty cents to one dollar ($0.30 to $1.00) per ton, but in the absence of a rule, the tonnage fee drops from fifty cents to thirty cents ($0.50 to $0.30). 6 CSR 250- 11.070, established by rule, set a permit fee from fertilizer distribu- tors. But in the absence of a rule, the amended statute did not allow for collection of a permit fee.

This emergency rule was filed May 24, 2017, becomes effective June 3, 2017, and expires November 29, 2017. 
(1) The fee provided to be established by this rule under section 266.331, RSMo, shall be sixty cents (60¢) for each ton of fertilizer reported with a minimum reporting fee of fifty dollars ($50) per reporting period. The last registered distributor selling fertilizer for use in Missouri shall be responsible for payment to the director of the fee provided by this rule. 
AUTHORITY: sections 266.331 and 266.336, RSMo 2016. Emergency rule filed May 24, 2017, effective June 3, 2017, expires Nov. 29, 2017. A proposed rule covering this same material is published in this issue of the Missouri Register.

(1) New applications for permits as well as renewal applications shall be accompanied by the annual permit fee of one hundred dollars ($100). The director shall collect fees and hold all fees in a separate fund that shall be utilized by the Fertilizer Control Board. 
AUTHORITY: sections 266.331 and 266.336, RSMo 2016. Emergency rule filed May 24, 2017, effective June 3, 2017, expires Nov. 29, 2017. A proposed rule covering this same material is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. 
Title 15—ELECTED OFFICIALS Division 30—Secretary of State Chapter 3—Voter Identification 
EMERGENCY RESCISSION 
15 CSR 30-3.010 Voter Identification Affidavit. This rule set out the identification requirements a potential voter must reach before being allowed to vote. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because the amendments to section 115.427, RSMo, effective June 1, 2017, do not allow a voter to be personally identified by election judges in lieu of having voter identification. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The secretary of state’s office deter- mined that this rescission is necessary to preserve a compelling gov- ernmental interest of ensuring the lawful and orderly conduct of elec- tions and the integrity of elections. 
The authority for this rescission is section 115.427, RSMo 2016 (voter identification law). Amendments to the section are in House Bill 1631, which was adopted by the General Assembly in 2016, but vetoed. The veto was overridden, but the statute would not become effective unless Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment authorizing photo identification requirements for elections. On November 8, 2016, the voters adopted Constitutional Amendment 6, authorizing photo identification for elections. The effective date of the statute is June 1, 2017; however, subsection (6) of section 115.427, RSMo states if there is an insufficient appropriation of state funds, the personal identification requirements shall not be enforced. House Bill 12, the appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2018 that includes the secretary of state’s office, was passed on May 4, 2017. 
The voter identification law applies to all public elections in Missouri. The City of St. Louis is conducting an aldermanic special election on July 11, 2017. There is a state special election for one (1) house seat and one (1) senate seat on August 8, 2017, a date on which there are also multiple local elections being conducted. 
Given the contingent effective date of the law and the necessity for an appropriation in order for it to be enforced, rescinding the rule through the non-emergency process would not result in it being effec- tive for the July and August 2017 elections. 
Subsection (9) of section 115.427, RSMo authorizes the secretary of state to promulgate rules to effectuate its provisions. Two (2) aspects of the law require rulemaking to implement: 1) the provision- al voting to be available to registered voters who do not show the identification as set forth in the law or do not sign a statement that they have no photo identification; and 2) the requirement that the secretary of state pay fees charged by other states, any court, or the federal government, so that a person without certain photo identifi- cation has the records he or she needs in order to obtain a free

Missouri non-driver’s license for voting. Rescission of this rule is needed as it is no longer allowed in the law. 
Local election authorities need the guidance provided by the rescission of this rule to conduct their upcoming elections, and the secretary of state’s office and the citizens need a companion emer- gency rule so that people can obtain documents needed in order to obtain a free Missouri non-driver’s license for voting purposes. 
The secretary of state’s office finds there is a compelling govern- mental interest that requires an early effective date for the rescission of this rule and therefore the filing of this rescission as an emergency rescission. A proposed rescission covering the same material is pub- lished in this issue of the Missouri Register. The scope of the emer- gency rescission is limited to the circumstances creating the emer- gency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The secretary of state’s office believes this emergency rescission is fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency rescission was filed May 22, 2017, becomes effective June 1, 2017, and expires February 22, 2018. 
AUTHORITY: section 115.427, RSMo Supp. 2002. Emergency rule filed Oct. 11, 2002, effective Oct. 21, 2002, expired April 18, 2003. Original rule filed Oct. 18, 2002, effective April 30, 2003.

Title 15—ELECTED OFFICIALS Division 30—Secretary of State Chapter 3—Voter Identification 
EMERGENCY RULE 
15 CSR 30-3.020 Provisional Ballots and Envelopes for Registered Voters under Voter Identification Law 
PURPOSE: This rule requires the secretary of state to provide provi- sional ballot envelopes for provisional ballots under section 115.457, RSMo, sets forth the contents of the envelope, and explains when a registered voter must be allowed to cast a provisional ballot. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The secretary of state’s office deter- mined that this rule is necessary to preserve a compelling governmen- tal interest of ensuring the lawful and orderly conduct of elections and the integrity of elections. 
The authority for this rule is section 115.427, RSMo 2016 (voter identification law). Amendments to the section are in House Bill 1631, which was adopted by the General Assembly in 2016, but vetoed. The veto was overridden, but the statute would not become effective unless Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment authorizing photo identification requirements for elections. On November 8, 2016, the voters adopted Constitutional Amendment 6, authorizing photo identification for elections. The effective date of the statute is June 1, 2017; however, subsection (6) of section 115.427, RSMo states if there is an insufficient appropriation of state funds, the personal identification requirements shall not be enforced. House Bill 12, the appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2018 that includes the secretary of state’s office, was passed on May 4, 2017. 
The voter identification law applies to all public elections in Missouri. The City of St. Louis is conducting an aldermanic special election on July 11, 2017. There is a state special election for one (1) house seat and one (1) senate seat on August 8, 2017, a date on which there are also multiple local elections being conducted. 
Given the contingent effective date of the law and the necessity for an appropriation in order for it to be enforced, promulgating the rule through the non-emergency process would not result in it being in place for the July and August 2017 elections. 
Subsection (9) of section 115.427, RSMo authorizes the secretary of state to promulgate rules to effectuate its provisions. Two (2) aspects of the law require rulemaking to implement: 1) the provision- al voting to be available to registered voters who do not show the identification as set forth in the law or do not sign a statement that they have no photo identification; and 2) the requirement that the sec- retary of state pay fees charged by other states, any court, or the fed- eral government, so that a person without certain photo identification has the records he or she needs in order to obtain a free Missouri non-driver’s license for voting. 
Local election authorities need the guidance provided by this rule to conduct their upcoming elections, and the secretary of state’s office and the citizens need a companion emergency rule so that peo- ple can obtain documents needed in order to obtain a free Missouri non-driver’s license for voting purposes. 
The secretary of state’s office finds there is a compelling govern- mental interest that requires an early effective date for this rule and therefore the filing of this rule as an emergency rule. A proposed rule covering the same material is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. The scope of the emergency rule is limited to the circum- stances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The sec- retary of state’s office believes this emergency rule is fair to all inter- ested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency rule was filed May 22, 2017, becomes effective June 1, 2017, and expires February 22, 2018. 
(1) The secretary of state shall produce one (1) size of envelope for provisional ballots for registered voters casting a provisional ballot under section 115.427.2(3) or 115.427.4, RSMo (voter ID provision- al ballot) and distribute them to each election authority. 
(A) The envelope shall be fourteen and one-half inches by nine and one-fourth inches (14 1/2" × 9 1/4"). All envelopes for voter ID pro- visional ballots shall be printed on a color of paper distinguishable from the provisional ballot envelope provided under section 115.430, RSMo and 15 CSR 30-8.010. 
(B) The envelope shall include the following: 1. Spaces for the voter’s full name, residential and mailing 
address, date of birth, last four (4) digits of his or her Social Security number, and optional daytime telephone number; 
2. A statement for the voter to read setting forth the requirement for his or her vote to be counted under subsection 4 of section 115.427, RSMo; 
3. A space for the voter’s signature and the date; and 
4. A section to be completed by election judges stating that the voter was allowed to cast a voter ID provisional ballot, with the print- ed name of the voter, election date, polling place number, and the sig- natures of the election judges. 
(2) A voter ID provisional ballot shall be provided to a voter if the following requirements are met: 
(A) The voter— 1. Does not present a form of identification set forth in subsec- 
tion 1 of section 115.427, RSMo or a form of identification set forth in subsection 2 of section 115.427, RSMo; or 
2. Presents one (1) of the forms of identification set forth in sub- section 2 of section 115.427, RSMo, but chooses not to execute the statement as set forth in subsection 3 of section 115.427, RSMo; and 
(B) The election judge examines the precinct register and deter- mines the voter is otherwise eligible to vote; and 
(C) The voter provides the information and signs the statement on the envelope for voter ID provisional ballot (voter ID provisional bal- lot envelope). 
(3) The election judges shall witness the signature of the voter affirm- ing the information and statement on the voter ID provisional ballot.

(1) If a voter that completed a photo ID provisional ballot and enve- lope returns to the polling place during the uniform polling hours established by section 115.407, RSMo, and provides a form of iden- tification set forth in subsection 1 of section 115.427, RSMo, one (1) of the following procedures shall be followed, at the choice of the election authority, but the chosen procedure shall be used at all polling places within the jurisdiction of the local election authority – 
(A) The election judges may retrieve the identified voter’s provi- sional ballot for registered voter (voter ID provisional ballot) enve- lope, hand it to the voter, who opens it and returns the empty enve- lope to the election judge, and then casts his or her ballot as a regular ballot by placing it in a precinct counter or regular ballot box. If the local election authority uses provisional ballots that are marked so that they will not be accepted by a precinct scanner, it may spoil the provisional ballot and issue the voter a regular ballot that can be cast by placing it in a precinct counter; or 
(B) The election judges may complete and sign a document iden- tifying the voter, stating the voter returned with the required form of identification, and place that document with the sealed voter ID pro- visional ballots for processing as provided in 15 CSR 30-3.040. 
(2) If the method in subsection (1)(A) of this rule is used, the election authority shall ensure that the voter ID provisional ballot envelope is marked as to the reason the ballot was counted and is retained as bal- lot material.

MISSOURI Proposed Rules July 3, 2017 REGISTER Vol. 42, No. 13 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

PROPOSED RULE 
15 CSR 30-3.030 Procedures for Registered Voters Returning to the Polling Place with Identification 
PURPOSE: This rule sets forth acceptable procedures for local elec- tion authorities to follow when a registered voter who cast a provision- al ballot returns to the polling place before the polling place closes with personal identification and wants to cast a regular ballot. 
(1) If a voter that completed a photo ID provisional ballot and enve- lope returns to the polling place during the uniform polling hours established by section 115.407, RSMo, and provides a form of iden- tification set forth in subsection 1 of section 115.427, RSMo, one (1) of the following procedures shall be followed, at the choice of the election authority, but the chosen procedure shall be used at all polling places within the jurisdiction of the local election authority: 
(A) The election judges may retrieve the identified voter’s provi- sional ballot for registered voter (voter ID provisional ballot) enve- lope, hand it to the voter, who opens it and returns the empty enve- lope to the election judge, and then casts his or her ballot as a regular ballot by placing it in a precinct counter or regular ballot box. If the local election authority uses provisional ballots that are marked so that they will not be accepted by a precinct scanner, it may spoil the provisional ballot and issue the voter a regular ballot that can be cast by placing it in a precinct counter; or 
(B) The election judges may complete and sign a document iden- tifying the voter, stating the voter returned with the required form of identification, and place that document with the sealed voter ID pro- visional ballots for processing as provided in 15 CSR 30-3.040. 
(2) If the method in subsection (1)(A) of this rule is used, the elec- tion authority shall ensure that the voter ID provisional ballot enve- lope is marked as to the reason the ballot was counted and is retained as ballot material.

By the authority vested in the Conservation Commission under sec- tions 40 and 45 of Art. IV, Mo. Const., the commission amends a rule as follows: 
3 CSR 10-12.110 Use of Boats and Motors is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on April 3, 2017 (42 MoReg 387). No changes have been made in the text of the pro- posed amendment, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed amend- ment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Conservation Commission received one (1) comment on this proposed amendment. 
COMMENT: Caleb Welch, Bolivar, indicated indecision regarding the proposed rulemaking but suggested that boats with gas motors be allowed for use on all lakes over two hundred (200) acres in size and those smaller than two hundred (200) acres should be designated as no-wake lakes. 
RESPONSE: The Department of Conservation (department) enters into Community Assistance Program (CAP) agreements with other public entities to ensure that all citizens have access to fishing oppor- tunities close to where they live. Boat and motor restrictions on CAP areas are identified on a case-by-case basis with input from the public entity that owns the waterbody. Under these agreements, the depart- ment provides resource management guidance and funding to enhance accessibility to the waterbody. Specific regulatory restrictions are established to promote safe resource use and ensure effective manage- ment of wildlife populations. No changes to the rule have been made as a result of this comment.

No changes have been made in the text of the pro- posed rule, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Children’s Division received one (1) comment on the proposed rule. 
COMMENT: Julie Schmitz, MSW, Show-Me Child Care, comment- ed that she would like clarification on how to conduct the searches of the state criminal and sex offender registries or repositories under 13 CSR 35-32.050(5)(A) and the National Crime Information Center under 13 CSR 35-32.050(5)(C). She asked if the searches should be conducted via email, in paper form, or through a website. Ms. Schmitz also commented that there is no fiscal note included with this new fingerprint requirement. She is sure there will be a fiscal impact. She also asked how this directly affects licensed child care facilities? 
RESPONSE: The Children’s Division believes that the processes on conducting these searches would not be appropriate as part of this definition. Each registry has it own process for conducting back- ground checks. Further, the only fingerprint requirements at this time are for providers serving four (4) or less unrelated children. This is not a new requirement for those providers. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment.

A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on February 1, 2017 (42 MoReg 185–187). No changes have been made in the text of the pro- posed rule, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Children’s Division received one (1) comment on the proposed rule. 
COMMENT: Julie Schmitz, MSW, Show-Me Child Care, comment- ed on the requirement of “Child Care participants may be required to pay a fee........... basis based on appropriations from the general assembly.” in 13 CSR 35-23.060(3)(C). “Clarify that this is a sliding fee for the child care assistance program NOT the same as the co- payment of individual centers. Many times families receiving assis- tance call me saying ‘I have to pay $3 a day for your center.’ When reality is that they will pay $3 sliding fee ONLY on the daily basis rate. I spend a lot of time trying to explain the difference to fami- lies.” 
RESPONSE: The Children’s Division believes that the regulation covers both sliding fee and co-payment requirements for recipients. Please see 13 CSR 35-32.060(3)(D). No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 35—Children’s Division Chapter 32—Child Care 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Children’s Division under sections 207.020, 210.025, and 210.027, RSMo 2016, the division adopts a rule as follows: 
13 CSR 35-32.070 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on February 1, 2017 (42 MoReg 187–194). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Children’s Division received comments on proposed rule 13 CSR 35-32.090. Because of these comments, the division made changes to this rule. 
COMMENT #1: Julie Schmitz, MSW, Show-Me Child Care, com- mented that the requirements of 13 CSR 35-32.090(1)(D) and (2)(B)11. are confusing. She stated, “The required CACFP topics which I think are being referred to in (2)(B)11. have changed. Will the listed ones be replaced with the new topics? What will the requirements in each of these sections be? I have received two con- flicting lists requirements. Upon contacting DSS, I am informed they will be updated again.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The Children’s Division believes that the list of required trainings have been clarified with changes to 13 CSR 35-32.070 and .090. 
COMMENT #2: Ms. Schmitz commented on the Private Cost Fiscal Note Assumptions: 
I do not feel your numbers reflect accurate data when CPR train- ing is reoccurring every two (2) years. All staff needs to be accounted for in this fiscal note even those considered already trained. 
The overall impact of these in-service hours creates more stress for small businesses to thrive. The addition of these regulations makes the financial strain excessive. The fiscal impact assumptions address the CPR training. Clarify the fiscal note for the additional twelve plus (12+) topics newly required. I see no fiscal note on them. Online or in-seat classes at $10 per unit equals $120 per staff mem- ber. Taking the estimated 23,894 staff (listed in the assumptions), the fiscal note would increase 23,894 x $10 = $238,940 additional fees per required topic. $238,940 x 11 additional topics = $2,628,340. 
There are some free classes available; however, many do not match the required topic and their availability on the mocalendar is restric- tive. RESPONSE: The Children’s Division believes that when calculating the fiscal note for CPR training, the division used National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies for an estimated number of child care staff. Due to licensed providers being required to have a specific number of staff trained in First Aid/CPR, the fiscal note was calculated by estimating the additional number of staff that would require training. 
The ten (10) health and safety topics required (does not include First Aid/CPR) will be available on-demand through the Missouri Workshop Calendar at no cost to the trainee. The training will be available no later than July 1, 2017. The training is two (2) hours in length and completion of the training will automatically be tracked through OPEN. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment.

Orders of Rulemaking 

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Children’s Division received comments on proposed rule 13 CSR 35-32.090. Because of these comments, the division made changes to this rule. 
COMMENT #1: Julie Schmitz, MSW, Show-Me Child Care, com- mented that the requirements of 13 CSR 35-32.090(1)(D) and 13 CSR 35-32.090(2)(B)11. are confusing. She stated, “The required CACFP topics which I think are being referred to in (2)(B)11. have changed. Will the listed ones be replaced with the new topics? What will the requirements in each of these sections be? I have received two conflicting lists requirements. Upon contacting DSS, I am informed they will be updated again.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The Children’s Division believes that the list of required trainings have been clarified with changes to 13 CSR 35-32.070 and .090. 
COMMENT #2: Ms. Schmitz commented that there was no need for any staff to take the Child Care Subsidy Orientation Training in 13 CSR 35-32.090(1)(D)2. unless they are directly involved with online invoicing, billing, etc. She recommended this item be removed or restricted to director status because this is excessive. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The Children’s Division recognized that this requirement was in this regulation and removed the requirement for all staff to complete this training from the regulation. 
COMMENT #3: Ms. Schmitz commented that in 13 CSR 35- 32.090(1)(D)3. and 4. there is a specific age on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome listed and there is no specific age listed on shaken baby. “Serves infants under the age of (1) year” needs to be added to the shaken baby requirement. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The Children’s Division recognized that this requirement was in this regulation and believes that the age of child provided care has been clarified in 13 CSR 35-32.090. Providers serving four (4) or less unrelated children are required to take the training because their registration does not limit ages in which they may provide care. Additionally, P.L. 113- 186 requires all child care providers and staff members receive train- ing for the “preventions of shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma” regardless of the ages of children served. 
COMMENT #4: Ms. Schmitz wrote in a comment concerning the time frame to meet the training requirements in 13 CSR 35- 32.090(1)(F). She stated: 
With all training having to go through the mocalendar, the 30 days 
is not realistic and increases the burden on small businesses. It is a challenge to find CPR locally on the mocalendar. I recommend allowing centers to scan and submit ANY Red Cross/American Heart Association training certificates of completion AND they count for in-service hours. We used to train with the local hospitals and can no longer do that for in service credit because their trainers are not on the “mocalendar.” I feel that mocalendar is very restrictive with available CPR. There has to be a less restrictive option. I suggest changing the 30 days to 90 days or allow for CPR certificates to be submitted. What is the explanation for not allowing local certified individuals to provide in service hours, especially with the increased requirement on CPR training? 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The Children’s Division recognized that this requirement was in this regulation and increased the time frame for completing training to ninety (90) days for 13 CSR 35-32.090. The use of trainings on the Missouri Workshop Calendar is voluntary. However, the verification of com- pleted training must be uploaded to the Opportunities in a Professional Education Network (OPEN). There is a process for trainers to follow in order to upload the information into OPEN that is available through the division. 
32.090 (2)(D)1. regarding who should be sent the corrective action plan. RESPONSE: The Children’s Division notifies the provider when a corrective action plan is needed. Please see 13 CSR 35-32.090(2)(D), which states “The division may require the licensed child care provider to submit and implement a corrective action plan....” No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #6: Ms. Schmitz commented on the Private Cost Fiscal Note Assumptions: 
I do not feel your numbers reflect accurate data when CPR train- ing is reoccurring every two (2) years. All staff needs to be accounted for in this fiscal note even those considered already trained. 
The overall impact of these in-service hours creates more stress for small businesses to thrive. The addition of these regulations makes the financial strain excessive. The fiscal impact assumptions address the CPR training. Clarify the fiscal note for the additional twelve plus (12+) topics newly required. I see no fiscal note on them. Online or in seat classes at $10 per unit equals $120 per staff mem- ber. Taking the estimated 23,894 staff (listed in the assumptions), the fiscal note would increase 23,894 x $10 = $238,940 additional fees per required topic. $238,940 x 11 additional topics = $2,628,340. 
There are some free classes available; however many do not match the required topic and their availability on the mocalendar is restric- tive. RESPONSE: The Children’s Division believes that when calculating the fiscal note for CPR training, the division used National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies for an estimated number of child care staff. Due to licensed providers being required to have a specific number of staff trained in First Aid/CPR, the fiscal note was calculated by estimating the additional number of staff that would require training. 
The ten (10) health and safety topics required (does not include First Aid/CPR) will be available on-demand through the Missouri Workshop Calendar at no cost to the trainee. The training will be available no later than July 1, 2017. The training is two (2) hours in length and completion of the training will automatically be tracked through OPEN. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
13 CSR 35-32.090 Registration Requirements for Licensed Child Care Facilities to Contract for State or Federal Child Care Funds 
(1) Requirements to Contract. To receive a contract from the depart- ment to receive state or federal funds, a licensed child care provider and staff shall meet the following requirements:

under 13 CSR 35-32.120(1)(D) and suggested possibly adding a number of days, such as ten (10) days? RESPONSE: The Children’s Division believes that unless mandated by federal or state statute, the division is not obligated to provide time frames in regulations.

Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 35—Children’s Division Chapter 32—Child Care 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Children’s Division under sections 207.020, 210.025, and 210.027, RSMo 2016, the division adopts a rule as follows: 
13 CSR 35-32.130 Recordkeeping is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on February 1, 2017 (42 MoReg 208–209). No changes have been made in the text of the pro- posed rule, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Children’s Division received two (2) comments on the proposed rule. 
COMMENT #1: Julie Schmitz, MSW, Show-Me Child Care, com- mented that she has been in “violation” of 13 CSR 35-32.130(2)(A)– (F) “because a parent has left information off their enrollment forms because the other parent is not involved and there is no pick up or drop off responsibilities. If a parent chooses not to disclose specific information, how should that be addressed?” 
RESPONSE: The Children’s Division believes that the example pro- vided by Ms. Schmitz does not appear to be a violation. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #2: Ms. Schmitz commented that she was seeking clar- ification on 13 CSR 35-32.130(2)–(6). “The child care provider shall, in addition, keep the records for such additional time periods that the department may request for audit or litigation purposes.” She stated: “It states to keep the records for 5 years. This is measurable. By adding ‘additional time periods,’ it makes it no longer measur- able. Remove this line or clarify with an exact amount of measurable time.” 
RESPONSE: The Children’s Division believes that the amount of time needed would be case specific due to the length of time for lit- igation and audit findings being unknown. A specific time frame can- not be defined in regulation but the division would instruct the provider, in a case specific situation, to hold records until further notice. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this com- ment. 
Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 70—MO HealthNet Division Chapter 15—Hospital Program

The individuals listed in this notice have recently filed applications requesting MoDOT to issue SPE Certificates to exempt them from the physical qualification requirements relating to vision in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(10), or to diabetes in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(3), which other- wise apply to drivers of CMVs in Missouri intrastate commerce. 
Under section 622.555, RSMo, MoDOT may issue an SPE Certificate, for not more than a two- (2-) year period, if it finds that the applicant has the ability, while operating CMVs, to maintain a level of safety that is equivalent to or greater than the driver qualifica- tion standards of 49 CFR 391.41. Upon application, MoDOT may renew an exemption upon expiration. 
Accordingly, the agency will evaluate the qualifications of each appli- cant to determine whether issuing an SPE Certificate will comply with the statutory requirements and will achieve the required level of safety. If granted, the SPE Certificate is only applicable to intrastate transportation wholly within Missouri.
