Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

(4) An electronic signature has the same legal effect and can be enforced in the same manner as a written signature. 
(5) Electronic records and electronic medical records are subject to the retention requirements set forth in 13 CSR 70-3.030 and 13 CSR 70-3.210.

(B) All entries in a participant’s electronic record or electronic medical record must be authenticated with a method established to identify the author. The method utilized may include computer keys/codes or voice authentication systems that utilize a personal identification number (PIN).

Providers must be able to demonstrate that adequate safeguards are maintained to protect against improper or unauthorized use of these methods;

(D) Providers’ electronic records and electronic medical records systems shall maintain an activity tracking system to monitor and record user activity for all documents in a participant’s record that are viewed, created, updated, or modified. The tracking system must record the following for each activity: 
1. User log-in and log-out dates and times; 2. User identification; 3. Device identification, such as a Media Assigned Control

signer cannot deny having signed the record. 
(7) Electronic medical records shall contain the following: (A) The name, title, and signature of the MO HealthNet enrolled 
provider delivering the service; and (B) The date the signature was executed. 
(8) The process of affixing an electronic signature shall require at least two (2) distinct identification components, such as an identifi- cation code and a password. 
(9) When a change is made to an electronic record or electronic health record, the following requirements apply: 
(A) All original records shall be maintained; and (B) Any edits or changes to the record shall be saved, and the

If a notary’s commission is ordered revoked after a hearing, [that person] the notary shall have the right to appeal the revocation order. 
(2) The secretary of state’s office may immediately suspend a notary’s commission upon written notice sent to the notary by cer- tified mail when the secretary of state’s office deems the situation has a serious unlawful effect on the general public.

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: Secretary of state staff made four (4) comments on this proposed rule.
