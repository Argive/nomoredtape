Emergency Rules
MISSOURI REGISTER
 Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances.
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable.
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures.
 Title 15—ELECTED OFFICIALS Division 30—Secretary of State
Chapter 110—Notary Use of Electronic Signatures and Seals
EMERGENCY RULE
15 CSR 30-110.010 Electronic Notary Definitions
PURPOSE: This rule provides definitions pertaining to the use of electronic signatures and seals by notaries.
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: This emergency rule is necessary to address statutory sections enacted in SB 932 (2016), specifically sec- tion 486.275.2, which became law on August 28, 2016. This legisla- tion provides that electronic signatures may now be used to satisfy certain acts currently performed by notaries in Missouri using origi- nal signatures. Section 486.275.2, RSMo states that “if a signature or record is required to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, notwithstanding the provisions of section 486.285 to the contrary, the requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the person authorized to perform such acts, together with all other
information required to be included, is attached to or logically asso- ciated with the signature or record.” Unfortunately, this section pro- vides no further guidance or direction to any Missouri notary public who may wish to utilize electronic signatures or electronic seals in the performance of notarial acts. To provide such direction to Missouri notaries, extensive research into e-notarization was com- pleted in developing this rule. From August 2016 to October of 2016, all current Missouri notary regulations were reviewed as well as other e-notarization laws and administrative rules throughout the United States. State administrators of e-notary systems in three (3) different states, the National Notary Association, and American Society of Notaries were consulted. After these consultations, confer- ence calls with stakeholders active in the passage of SB 932 took place. These stakeholders were then provided with draft rules to be reviewed. Throughout October through December of 2016, the feed- back from stakeholders regarding the draft rules was collected and was taken into account in producing updated language. Without this emergency rule in place, notaries wanting to use an electronic signa- ture will be forced to proceed without any direction from the State of Missouri. Providing guidance will be beneficial to notaries who wish to complete important transactions in Missouri with electronic signa- tures. As such, the Office of the Secretary of State finds a compelling governmental interest to provide notaries public with guidance in the form of minimum standards and procedures as soon as possible utiliz- ing an emergency rule. The scope of this emergency rule is limited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the pro- tections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. After reviewing laws and regulations pertaining to this subject matter in other states and after communicating with numerous stakeholders within Missouri, the Office of the Secretary of State believes this emer- gency rule is fair to all interested persons and parties under the cir- cumstances. This emergency rule was filed December 21, 2016, becomes effective December 31, 2016, and expires June 28, 2017.
(1) The following definitions, except where inconsistent with Chapter 486, RSMo, shall mean:
(A) “Capable of independent verification” means that any interest- ed person may confirm the validity of a notary public’s identity and authority through a publicly accessible system;
(B) “Electronic” means relating to technology having electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic, or similar capa- bilities;
(C) “Electronic signature” means a symbol that is executed with technology having electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic, or similar capabilities and is attached to or logically associated with an electronic record and is executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record;
(D) “Electronic seal” means an electronic representation of a notary’s seal;
(E) “Electronic notarial certificate” means the portion of a nota- rized electronic document that is completed by the notary public, bears the notary public’s electronic signature and electronic seal, and meets all other statutory requirements of this state regarding notarial certificates;
(F) “Principal” means an individual whose signature is notarized, or an individual, other than a witness required for the electronic nota- rization, taking an oath or affirmation from the notary public;
(G) “Record” means information that is inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form; and
(H) “Sole control” means at all times being in the direct physical custody of the notary public or safeguarded by the notary with a pass- word or other secure means of authentication.

Title 11—DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY Division 45—Missouri Gaming Commission Chapter 40—Fantasy Sports Contests
ORDER OF RULEMAKING
By the authority vested in the Missouri Gaming Commission (MGC) under section 313.955, RSMo 2016, the commission adopts a rule as follows:
11 CSR 45-40.010 is adopted.
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on October 3, 2016 (41 MoReg 1313–1314). Changes have been made to the text of the pro- posed rule, so it is reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effec- tive thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations.
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: A public hearing was held on this proposed rule on November 2, 2016. Three (3) people commented on this proposed rule at the public hearing and also submitted their comments in writing. MGC staff commented on this rule.
COMMENT #1: Sean Ostrow, on behalf of Fan Duel, and Derek Hein, on behalf of Draft Kings, commented that the net revenue and resident percentage definitions are problematic because they could lead to double taxation if a Missouri resident submitted an entry fee while physically located in another state that bases its tax on geo- location.
RESPONSE: The definitions used to calculate the annual operation fee based on Missouri residency were included in the Missouri Fantasy Sports Consumer Protection Act (The Act). The Missouri Gaming Commission does not have the authority to alter or vary from the provisions of the statute.
COMMENT #2: Mr. Ostrow and Mr. Hein suggested removing the inclusion of “free entry,” as they do not believe it was the intent of the legislation to require regulation of free contests. The statute specifically refers to “cash” and “cash equivalents,” but indicates no intent to regulate free play contests.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: A revision was made to clarify that the definition for entry fees would include free
entries for paid contests, not free entries to contests that are free to all participants.
COMMENT #3: Daniel Haight, on behalf of Yahoo!, suggested redefining Fantasy Sports Contest Operator to limit it to the division within the larger company that operates the Fantasy Sports Contests. RESPONSE: The definition of Fantasy Sports Contest Operator mir- rors the definition in The Act. The Missouri Gaming Commission does not have the authority to alter or vary from the provisions of the statute. No change was made in response to this comment.
COMMENT #4: The MGC noted that the Revisor of the Missouri Revised Statutes renumbered the sections of the statute created by HB 1941, the Missouri Fantasy Sports Consumer Protection Act (The Act).
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion revised section (7) and the authority section of this rule to ref- erence the renumbered sections of The Act.
11 CSR 45-40.010 Definitions
(2) Entry fee—anything of value including, but not limited to, contest credit, free entry to a paid contest, cash, or a cash equivalent, that a fantasy sports contest operator collects in order to participate in a fantasy sports contest.
(7) Licensed operator—an FSCO licensed pursuant to section 313.910, RSMo, to offer FSCs for play on an authorized internet website in Missouri.
AUTHORITY: sections 313.950 and 313.955, RSMo 2016. Emergency rule filed Aug. 29, 2016, effective Sept. 8, 2016, expires March 6, 2017. Original rule filed Aug. 29, 2016.
Title 11—DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY Division 45—Missouri Gaming Commission Chapter 40—Fantasy Sports Contests
ORDER OF RULEMAKING
By the authority vested in the Missouri Gaming Commission (MGC) under section 313.955, RSMo 2016, the commission adopts a rule as follows:
11 CSR 45-40.020 is adopted.
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on October 3, 2016 (41 MoReg 1314–1315). Changes have been made to the text of the pro- posed rule, so it is reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effec- tive thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations.
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: A public hearing was held on this proposed rule on November 2, 2016. One (1) person commented on this proposed rule at the public hearing and also submitted those comments in writing. The MGC staff commented on this rule.
COMMENT #1 Daniel Haight, on behalf of Yahoo!, commented that he had concerns regarding exhibit #5 and #12 of the Fantasy Sports Contest Operator Application. He wants the application to be restricted to obtaining information from the division of the operator focused on paid fantasy sports contests, and not other businesses the applicant runs. Alternatively, he suggested the regulations should give the commission discretion to make modifications to the applica- tion on a case-by-case basis, particularly when dealing with compa- nies that have various and unrelated product offerings. Additionally,

 Page 276

 Orders of Rulemaking
  he stated, “This rule should apply not only to background checks, but to provisions of The Act and associated regulations that request provision of several years of all of a company’s tax returns and asso- ciated audits and adjustments. Indeed, it should also be made clear that the required information is restricted to tax returns in Missouri. Further, the provisions requiring personal information of Yahoo employees should be limited to those who oversee our paid fantasy offerings, and there should be a similar limitation in the rules regard- ing accounting representations, accounting reps, bank accounts and representatives, legal representatives, and underwriters. Finally, peo- ple who are authorized to sign the license application on behalf of the company should also be the ones who run the fantasy sports busi- ness.”
RESPONSE: Section 313.910, RSMo, requires the commission to provide forms on which the applicant demonstrates financial suitabil- ity consistent with the best interest of the Missouri fantasy sports industry. 11 CSR 45-1.100 gives the commission the authority to waive or grant a variance to any provision of this rule other than those mandated by the relevant statutes. No changes were made in response to this comment.
COMMENT #2: Mr. Haight stated that “Every officer, board direc- tor and general partner should not be required to be fingerprinted by the FBI when only a small portion of that entity’s business is devoted to paid fantasy sports.”
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: It was not the intent of the commission to request an FSCO Personal Disclosure Form from every employee or key person of every applicant, only those specified by the commission. The language in section (3) was revised to clarify this intent.
COMMENT #3: Mr. Haight stated, “Specifically, 11 CSR 45- 40.020 Application for Fantasy Sports Contest Operator License, and the associated ‘Applicant’s Authorization and Request to Release Information’ form, gives the Missouri State Highway Patrol and MGC Financial Investigators a very broad (and lengthy in duration) power of attorney which would allow for requests of documentation that are unrelated to Yahoo’s Fantasy Sports business, as well as per- mits Missouri to sign documents as an agent of Yahoo. In order for Yahoo to submit our application, we would have to waive any privi- lege with regard to confidential information (which may be unrelated to our Fantasy Sports business), and via the Release of Claims doc- ument, release the State from any claim resulting from a disclosure of such information.”
RESPONSE: The commission’s ability to fulfill its statutory obliga- tion to investigate applicants pursuant to 313.950, RSMo, would be inhibited without a completed “Applicant’s Authorization and Request to Release Information” form. Section 313.910, RSMo, requires the commission to provide forms on which the applicant demonstrates experience, reputation, competence, and financial responsibility consistent with the best interest of the Missouri fantasy sports industry. 11 CSR 45-1.100 gives the commission the authority to waive or grant a variance to any provision of this rule other than those mandated by the relevant statutes. No changes were made in response to this comment.
COMMENT #4: The MGC noted that the name of the person autho- rized to receive this information on Form 943 needed to be revised. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion revised Form 943 of the Fantasy Sports Contest Operator Application to change the name of the individual to whom the appli- cant’s tax information is to be released.
COMMENT #5: The MGC noted that the Revisor of the Missouri Revised Statutes renumbered the sections of the statute created by HB 1941, the Missouri Fantasy Sports Consumer Protection Act (The Act).
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis-
sion revised the Application which is incorporated by reference, sec- tion (2), and the authority section to reference the renumbered sec- tions of The Act.
COMMENT #6: The MGC noted that the FSCO Personal Disclosure Form needed to be updated to include new codes for the Place of Birth and the Country of Citizenship.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion revised the FSCO Personal Disclosure Form to include changes for the new codes and section (3).
11 CSR 45-40.020 Application for Fantasy Sports Contest Operator License
(2) Application for licensure shall be made on the Fantasy Sports Contest Operator Application (application), which the commission adopts and incorporates by reference herein, as published by the Missouri Gaming Commission, 3417 Knipp Dr., PO Box 1847, Jefferson City, MO 65102, and which may be accessed at http://www.mgc.dps.mo.gov.

(3) The applicant shall be responsible for ensuring the FSCO Personal Disclosure Form is completed by those key persons, employees, or other individuals requested by the commission. The requested FSCO Personal Disclosure Forms and the required finger- print sets shall be submitted within thirty (30) days of the commis- sion’s request. The commission adopts and incorporates by reference herein, the FSCO Personal Disclosure Form, as published by the Missouri Gaming Commission, 3417 Knipp Dr., PO Box 1847, Jefferson City, MO 65102, and which may be accessed at http://www.mgc.dps.mo.gov.

AUTHORITY: sections 313.910, 313.925, 313.935, 313.950, and 313.955, RSMo 2016. Emergency rule filed Aug. 29, 2016, effective Sept. 8, 2016, expires March 6, 2017. Original rule filed Aug. 29, 2016.
Title 11—DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY Division 45—Missouri Gaming Commission Chapter 40—Fantasy Sports Contests
ORDER OF RULEMAKING
By the authority vested in the Missouri Gaming Commission (MGC) under section 313.955, RSMo 2016, the commission adopts a rule as follows:
11 CSR 45-40.030 is adopted.
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on October 3, 2016 (41 MoReg 1315–1316). Changes have been made to the text of the pro- posed rule, so it is reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effec- tive thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations.
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: A public hearing was held on this proposed rule on November 2, 2016. Two (2) people commented on this proposed rule at the public hearing and also submitted those comments in writing. The MGC staff commented on this rule.
COMMENT #1: Derek Hein, on behalf of DraftKings, noted con- cerns with subsection (1)(F) as follows: “DraftKings offers its users

  February 15, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 4
  Missouri Register
Page 277
  site credits that can only be used to enter contests on the site, but can- not be withdrawn as cash. For clarity, we suggest that these site cred- its be explicitly excluded from these requirements.”
RESPONSE: The language of the rule mirrors the Missouri Fantasy Sports Consumer Protection Act. The Missouri Gaming Commission does not have the authority to alter or vary from the provisions of the statute. No changes were made as a result of this comment.
Due to the similarity of the following two (2) comments, they are addressed with one (1) response.
COMMENT #2: Sean Ostrow, on behalf of FanDuel, stated, “This section requires a FSCO to submit their internal procedures for the most important consumer protections for approval by the MGC. We believe this is an important provision, however, we have concerns that subsection (4), which restricts the FSCO from altering such proce- dures until such changes are approved by the commission, is too restrictive to allow us to operate effectively. Because we are at heart a technology company in a rapidly evolving industry, we must have the capacity to innovate and adapt to rising challenges and make changes as necessary to comply with other state regulatory obliga- tions. For the benefit of customers across the nation, there may be instances in which we must modify internal procedures without undue delay. We believe that having to seek Commission approval prior to implementation of such a procedural change would be counter-productive to the stated goal of consumer protection. As long as the stated objectives are met, we believe we should have the ability to make necessary changes without prior authorization from the MGC. We propose that subsection (4) be rewritten as follows – ‘Once approved, no licensed operator shall alter its procedures in a manner which substantially affects the stated objective of such procedures as described in subsections (1)(A) through (H) unless and until the change is approved by the commission. For alterations to procedures which do not substantially affect the stated objective, the licensed operator shall notify the commission within thirty (30) business days of such alteration.’ ”
COMMENT #3: Regarding 11 CSR 45-40.030(4) and (5), Derek Hein of DraftKings stated, “As a technology company that operates in a rapidly changing industry, DraftKings must have the ability to quickly implement procedural changes to serve customers across the world. We believe that requiring operators to seek prior approval of MGC for implementation of procedure changes could potentially be burdensome and counter-productive to the goal of protecting con- sumers. DraftKings suggests the current language be amended to require operators to provide notice of procedure changes within fif- teen days of implementing such a change.”
RESPONSE: Section 313.915, RSMo, requires the commission to approve specific types of procedures relating to consumer protection prior to operating in Missouri. Those procedures are outlined in sec- tion (1) of this rule. Any change to those procedures without com- mission approval would not comply with the statute. The Missouri Gaming Commission does not have the authority to alter or vary from the provisions of the statute. No changes were made as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #4: The MGC noted that the Revisor of the Missouri Revised Statutes renumbered the sections of the statute created by HB 1941, the Missouri Fantasy Sports Consumer Protection Act (The Act).
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion revised subsection (1)(F) and the authority section of this rule to reference the renumbered sections of The Act.
11 CSR 45-40.030 Commission Approval of Procedures
(1) Prior to operating in Missouri, each applicant for a Fantasy Sports Contest Operator (FSCO) License shall submit procedures to the commission that—
(F) Ensure registered players can withdraw the funds maintained
in their individual accounts, whether such accounts are open or closed, within five (5) business days of the request being made, unless the licensed operator believes in good faith that the registered player engaged in either fraudulent conduct or other conduct that would put the licensed operator in violation of sections 313.900 to 313.955, RSMo, in which case the licensed operator may decline to honor the request for withdrawal for a reasonable investigatory peri- od until its investigation is resolved if it provides notice of the nature of the investigation to the registered player. For the purposes of this provision, a request for withdrawal will be considered honored if it is processed by the licensed operator but delayed by a payment processor, credit card issuer, or by the custodian of a financial account;
AUTHORITY: sections 313.915, 313.920, 313.950, and 313.955, RSMo 2016. Emergency rule filed Aug. 29, 2016, effective Sept. 8, 2016, expires March 6, 2017. Original rule filed Aug. 29, 2016.
Title 11—DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY Division 45—Missouri Gaming Commission Chapter 40—Fantasy Sports Contests
ORDER OF RULEMAKING
By the authority vested in the Missouri Gaming Commission (MGC) under section 313.955, RSMo Supp. 2016, the commission adopts a rule as follows:
11 CSR 45-40.040 is adopted.
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on October 3, 2016 (41 MoReg 1316). Changes have been made to the text of the proposed rule, so it is reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations.
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: A public hearing was held on this proposed rule on November 2, 2016. Two (2) people commented on this proposed rule at the public hearing and also submitted those comments in writing. The MGC staff commented on this rule.
COMMENT #1: Sean Ostrow, on behalf of FanDuel, requested sec- tion (1) “be qualified by a limitation on the types of information requested by the MGC,” by modifying the language to read, “All licensed operators shall provide all information pertaining to Missouri fantasy sports contests requested by the commission.” In addition, he also asked for clarification regarding “the manner of access/transmittal proposed by the MGC.”
RESPONSE: Adding the phrase “pertaining to Missouri fantasy sports contests” would limit access to information potentially needed for fulfilling the commission’s statutory duties. The manner of access/transmittal would vary based on the type and size of the requested information. No changes were made as a result of this com- ment.
COMMENT #2: Derek Hein, on behalf of DraftKings, suggested that “the MGC consider changing the time period for requested doc- uments to be provided to the Commission from seven days to thirty days” in section (1).
RESPONSE: Delaying access to information for thirty (30) days could hamper the ability of the commission to perform its statutory duties. The existing language of the rule grants discretion to the com- mission in setting a timeframe for delivery of the requested informa- tion. No changes were made as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #3: Mr. Ostrow, on behalf of FanDuel, expressed con- cerns regarding the breadth of subsection (6)(D) which would require

 Page 278

 Orders of Rulemaking
  reporting “potentially minor criminal infractions, concerning all employees. As a company with over three hundred (300) employees in multiple states and countries, we believe this is unduly burden- some and impracticable, and would request that this reporting requirement not extend beyond those enumerated ‘key persons’.” RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Section 313.910.4(2), RSMo, grants the commission the discretion to revoke or suspend any licensee if one (1) of the licensees employees “Is or has pled guilty or been convicted of any illegal, corrupt, or fraudu- lent act, practice, or conduct in connection with any fantasy sports contest in this or any other state or has pled guilty or been convicted of a felony, a crime of moral turpitude, or any criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust within the ten years prior to the date of application for registration.” Section (6) was revised to limit the reporting requirements to include only those offenses that could lead to denial, suspension, or revocation of a Fantasy Sports Contest Operator license as set forth in the statute.
COMMENT #4: The MGC noted that the Revisor of the Missouri Revised Statutes renumbered the sections of the statute created by HB 1941, the Missouri Fantasy Sports Consumer Protection Act (The Act).
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion revised section (4) and the authority section of this rule to ref- erence the renumbered sections of The Act.
11 CSR 45-40.040 Fantasy Sports Contest Operator Responsibilities
(4) For the purposes of this rule, “material change” shall mean any change in personal identification or residence information, such as name, address, and phone number; information required in section 313.945, RSMo; or other information that might affect an applicant or licensed operator’s suitability to hold an FSCO license, including, but not limited to, significant changes in financial condition, legally defaulting on a debt owed to the state of Missouri, arrests, convic- tions, guilty pleas, disciplinary actions, or license denial, suspen- sion, or revocation in other jurisdiction(s).
(6) In addition to all other reporting requirements, FSCO license applicants and licensed operators shall notify the commission within fifteen (15) days after receiving notification that any of the following persons has received a subpoena or is the target of, has been disci- plined by, or has been charged in connection with an investigation by a regulatory, administrative, or prosecutorial agency of a violation of a rule, regulation, or statute relating to licensed gambling, fantasy sports contests, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regula- tions, or criminal offenses, to include any illegal, corrupt, or fraud- ulent act, practice, or conduct in connection with any fantasy sports contest in Missouri or any other state, a felony, a crime of moral turpitude, or any criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust (an “offense” does not include infractions, traffic violations, or parking violations, except for driving while revoked/suspended, alco- hol/drug-related traffic violations, and leaving the scene of an acci- dent):
AUTHORITY: sections 313.910, 313.915, 313.925, 313.930, 313.935, 313.950, and 313.955, RSMo 2016. Emergency rule filed Aug. 29, 2016, effective Sept. 8, 2016, expires March 6, 2017. Original rule filed Aug. 29, 2016.
Title 11—DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY Division 45—Missouri Gaming Commission Chapter 40—Fantasy Sports Contests
ORDER OF RULEMAKING
By the authority vested in the Missouri Gaming Commission under section 313.955, RSMo 2016, the commission adopts a rule as fol- lows:
11 CSR 45-40.050 is adopted.
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on October 3, 2016 (41 MoReg 1316–1319). Changes have been made to the text of the pro- posed rule, so it is reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effec- tive thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations.
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: A public hearing was held on this proposed rule on November 2, 2016. One (1) person commented on this proposed rule at the public hearing and submitted those com- ments in writing. The MGC staff commented on this rule.
COMMENT #1: Derek Hein, on behalf of DraftKings, expressed concern “that the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) may create extremely high overhead. DraftKings suggests an exception in the rules for temporary testing of software and technologies.” RESPONSE: The Missouri Fantasy Sports Consumer Protection Act requires that the licensee maintain certain operational requirements. The commission needs to have the current set of procedures in order to monitor compliance with the statute. No changes were made as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #2: Mr. Hein suggested that the time period for submit- ting supplemental documents be changed from five (5) days to fifteen (15) days. DraftKings expects to be able to produce most materials within five (5) days, but expressed concern that there can be signifi- cant work required in gathering all materials and is requesting a longer period of time to provide those materials.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The requested change was made to section (2).
COMMENT #3: Mr. Hein stated “DraftKings does not perform age verification checks on those registering for an account, but performs the check before a user funds their account or participates in any con- tests. DraftKings performs the age verification check when an indi- vidual makes their first deposit.”
RESPONSE: Section 313.920.9, RSMo, provides that licensed oper- ators shall take commercially reasonable steps to confirm that an indi- vidual opening an account is not a minor. The Missouri Gaming Commission does not have the authority to alter or vary from the pro- visions of the statute. No changes were made as a result of this com- ment.
COMMENT #4: The MGC noted that the Revisor of the Missouri Revised Statutes renumbered the sections of the statute created by HB 1941, the Missouri Fantasy Sports Consumer Protection Act (The Act).
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion revised sections (3), (4), and the authority section of this rule to reference the renumbered sections of The Act.
11 CSR 45-40.050 Operational Requirements for Fantasy Sports Contest Operators
(2) The information required by section (1) and all supplemental doc- uments shall be submitted with the initial application and within fif- teen (15) days of any subsequent revision.
(3) Upon request, each licensed operator shall provide the commis- sion with a current and accurate list of Missouri residents who have submitted the operator’s online self-exclusion form, which the licensed operator developed pursuant to section 313.920, RSMo.

  February 15, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 4

  (4) Each licensed operator shall take commercially and technologi- cally reasonable measures to comply with the provisions of sections 313.915 and 313.920, RSMo, regarding the verification of each FSC player’s true identity, date of birth, and address, including, but not limited to, independent verification of age using information obtained from independent sources outside of the player seeking to open an account. Third party services may be used to verify the age of a play- er. Each licensed operator shall use such information, at a minimum, to prevent underage individuals from establishing accounts, to verify state of residence, and to prevent players from establishing more than one (1) account or username or playing anonymously.
AUTHORITY: sections 313.915, 313.920, 313.925, 313.950, and 313.955, RSMo 2016. Emergency rule filed Aug. 29, 2016, effective Sept. 8, 2016, expires March 6, 2017. Original rule filed Aug. 29, 2016.
Title 11—DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY Division 45—Missouri Gaming Commission Chapter 40—Fantasy Sports Contests
ORDER OF RULEMAKING
By the authority vested in the Missouri Gaming Commission (MGC) under section 313.955, RSMo 2016, the commission adopts a rule as follows:
11 CSR 45-40.060 is adopted.
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on October 3, 2016 (41 MoReg 1320–1322). Changes have been made to the text of the pro- posed rule, so it is reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effec- tive thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations.
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: A public hearing was held on this proposed rule on November 2, 2016. Two (2) people commented on this proposed rule at the public hearing and also submitted their com- ments in writing. The MGC staff commented on this rule.
COMMENT #1: Derek Hein, on behalf of DraftKings, stated that in subparagraph (2)(B)3.A. “the special purpose entity contemplated by the regulations, which DraftKings currently hold player funds in, does not hold player funds in trust.” DraftKings suggested the fol- lowing language: “The segregated account is established and player funds are held securely for the benefit and protection of authorized players.”
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: This subpara- graph was revised by deleting “in trust.”
Due to the similarity of the following two (2) comments, they are addressed with one (1) response.
COMMENT #2: Mr. Hein expressed concern that reporting on play- ers’ deposit accounts and the licensee’s cash reserves on a monthly basis as currently required in section (5) would be overly burden- some, especially given the other requirements in this section. DraftKings suggests that the requirements in this section be changed from monthly to quarterly.
COMMENT #3: Sean Ostrow, on behalf of FanDuel, stated, “We appreciate these well-reasoned and comprehensive rules, in particular the flexibility permitted in allowing fantasy sports operators various methods to comply with the requirement that player funds be protect- ed at all times. Our only concern is that section (5) requires an FSCO to report balance sheets on a monthly basis, which we believe will be difficult and extremely laborious to comply with. Given the require- ments of auditing and the other requirements of this section, we
believe that this additional reporting requirement is unnecessary and should be removed. In the alternative, we would like to see the fre- quency of these reports decreased to every three (3) or six (6) months.”
RESPONSE: Section 313.915.3(4), RSMo, requires fantasy sports contest operators to “maintain a reserve in the form of cash or cash equivalents in the amount of the deposits made to the accounts of fan- tasy sports contest players for the benefit and protection of the funds held in such accounts.” Information received from the industry indi- cated that they routinely perform monthly reconciliations of the play- er accounts. Inability of the commission to receive this information on a monthly basis would hamper its ability to ensure statutory com- pliance. No changes were made as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #4: The MGC noted that the Revisor of the Missouri Revised Statutes renumbered the sections of the statute created by HB 1941, the Missouri Fantasy Sports Consumer Protection Act (The Act).

COMMENT #1: Donald C. Otto, on behalf of the Missouri Funeral Directors & Embalmers Association, commented that the proposed amendment may overlap with rulemaking authority granted the board by regulating the conduct of individuals who are not insurance pro- ducers.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The director appreciates this comment and has modified the definition of preneed funeral contract or prearrangement in subsection (1)(I) and clarified obligations in subsections (3)(B) and (4)(N).
20 CSR 400-5.100 Advertisements of Life Insurance and Annuities

(I) “Preneed funeral contract or prearrangement” shall have the
same meaning as set forth in section 436.405.1(8), RSMo.
(3) Form and Content of Advertisements.
(B) No advertisement shall use the terms “investment,” “invest-
ment plan,” “founder’s plan,” “charter plan,” “deposit,” “expansion plan,” “profit,” “profits,” “profit sharing,” “interest plan,” “sav- ings,” “savings plan,” “private pension plan,” “retirement plan,” “preneed contract,” “preneed funeral contract,” “prearrangement”, or other similar terms in connection with a policy in a context or under such circumstances or conditions as to have the capacity or tendency to mislead a purchaser or prospective purchaser of such policy to believe that s/he will receive, or that it is possible that s/he will receive, something other than a policy or some benefit not avail- able to other persons of the same class and equal expectation of life.
(4) Disclosure Requirements.
(N) No insurance producer may use terms such as “financial plan-
ner,” “investment adviser,” “financial consultant,” “financial coun- seling,” “seller,” “preneed seller,” or “preneed agent” in such a way as to imply that he or she is generally engaged in an advisory busi- ness in which compensation is unrelated to sales unless that actually is the case. This provision is not intended to preclude persons who hold some form of formal recognized financial planning or consultant designation from using this designation. This provision also is not intended to preclude persons who are members of a recognized trade or professional association having such terms as part of its name from citing the membership, providing that a person citing the mem- bership, if authorized only to sell insurance products, shall disclose that fact. This provision does not permit persons to charge an addi- tional fee for services that are customarily associated with the solic- itation, negotiation, or servicing of policies.

20 CSR 400-5.800 is adopted.

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The director received three (3) com- ments on the proposed rule.
COMMENT #1: Chelsea Crucitti, on behalf of the Insured Retirement Institute (IRI), a national trade association, requested that the rule be amended to include a drafting note in section (3), Applicability and Scope (from a 2013 draft of National Association of Insurance Commissioners Model #245), to clarify that certain pro- visions in the model are effective unless action is taken by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or could be preempted by the National Securities Market Improvement Act (NSMIA). RESPONSE: The director appreciates this comment. The 2015 ver- sion of the NAIC model #245 declined to include the drafting note. The director respects the wisdom of the NAIC process and no changes were made to the rule as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #2: Charles “Chip” Anderson, on behalf of the National Association for Fixed Annuities (NAFA), suggested the definition of “Buyer’s Guide” in subsection (2)(A) be modified to incorporate two (2) additional NAIC buyer’s guides.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The director appreciates this comment. The 2015 version of the NAIC model #245 did not include all guides, but has made three (3) guides avail- able. The director modified the rule to reflect the suggested changes.
COMMENT #3: Bryan Cox, on behalf of the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI), commented that ACLI actively supports the adoption of the amendment. Chelsea Crucitti, on behalf of the Insured Retirement Institute (IRI), expressed similar support, gener- ally.
RESPONSE: The director appreciates the expression of support. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of these comments.

ORDER OF RULEMAKING
By the authority vested in the director of the Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration under section 374.045, RSMo 2016, the director adopts a rule as follows:
20 CSR 400-5.900 is adopted.
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on November 1, 2016 (41 MoReg 1617–1619). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations.
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The director received three (3) com- ments on the proposed rule.
COMMENT #1: Chelsea Crucitti, on behalf of the Insured Retirement Institute (IRI), and Bryan Cox, on behalf of the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI), national trade associations, request- ed that the definition of, and references to, “Tangible Net Benefit” be eliminated because it “presumes that the sole consideration influ- encing the decision whether to purchase a particular annuity product is a tangible benefit; however, there could be numerous indirect ben- efits, such as a preference for certain guarantees over the prospect for greater growth, the reputation of the insurance company, the insur- ance company’s financial rating, the relationship with a particular producer customer service, and access to the customer portals to name a few, that could be equally important to consumers, particu- larly senior consumers.”
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The director appreciates this comment and has removed references to “Tangible Net Benefit” throughout by removing subsection (3)(J) and amending subsections (4)(A) and (4)(C).
COMMENT #2: Chelsea Crucitti, on behalf of IRI, commented that the proposal does not include an effective date and requested that the proposal become effective at least six (6) months after adoption in order to allow companies adequate time to prepare for compliance. RESPONSE: The director appreciates this comment. The effective date is set by statute as thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. It is the director’s opinion that the time between filing the proposed rule and the ultimate effective date provide suffi- cient time to prepare for compliance. No changes were made to the rule in response to this comment.
COMMENT #3: Charles “Chip” Anderson, on behalf of the National Association for Fixed Annuities, (NAFA), commented to express NAFA’s support for the rule’s adoption.
RESPONSE: The director appreciates this comment. No changes were made to the rule in response to this comment.
20 CSR 400-5.900 Suitability in Annuity Transactions
(4) Duties of Insurers and of Insurance Producers.
(A) In recommending to a consumer the purchase of an annuity or
the exchange of an annuity that results in another insurance transac- tion or series of insurance transactions, the insurance producer, or the insurer where no producer is involved, shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the recommendation is suitable for the con- sumer on the basis of the facts disclosed by the consumer as to his or her investments and other insurance products and as to his or her financial situation and needs, including the consumer’s suitability information, and that there is a reasonable basis to believe all of the following:
1. The consumer has been reasonably informed of various fea- tures of the annuity, such as the potential surrender period and sur- render charge, potential tax penalty if the consumer sells, exchanges, surrenders, or annuitizes the annuity, mortality and expense fees, investment advisory fees, potential charges for and features of riders, limitations on interest returns, insurance and investment components, and market risk. The requirements of this rule are intended to sup- plement and do not replace any disclosure requirements in other rules or statutes;
2. The particular annuity as a whole, the underlying subac- counts to which funds are allocated at the time of purchase or exchange of the annuity, and riders and similar product enhance- ments, if any, are suitable (and in the case of an exchange or replace- ment, the transaction as a whole is suitable) for the particular con- sumer based on his or her suitability information; and
3. In the case of an exchange or replacement of an annuity, the exchange or replacement is suitable including taking into considera- tion whether—
A. The consumer will incur a surrender charge, be subject to the commencement of a new surrender period, lose existing benefits (such as death, living, or other contractual benefits), or be subject to increased fees, investment advisory fees, charges for riders, and sim- ilar product enhancements;
B. The consumer would benefit from product enhancements and improvements; and
C. The consumer has had another annuity exchange or replacement and, in particular, an exchange or replacement within the preceding thirty-six (36) months.
(C) Except as permitted under subsection (4)(D), an insurer shall not issue an annuity recommended to a consumer unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the annuity is suitable based on the con- sumer’s suitability information.

ORDER OF RULEMAKING
By the authority vested in the director of the Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration under sections 374.045 and 376.465, RSMo 2016, the director adopts a rule as follows:
20 CSR 400-13.100 is adopted.
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on November 1, 2016 (41

 Page 284

 Orders of Rulemaking
  MoReg 1619–1621). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations.
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: A public hearing on this proposed rule was held December 2, 2016 and the public comment period ended on December 2, 2016. At the public hearing, the department’s Market Regulation Division Director explained the new rule and eight (8) comments were made.
COMMENT #1: Pam Rich, on behalf of Empower Missouri, com- mented that her organization is appreciative of the efforts undertaken to bring transparency to Missouri consumers with regard to health insurance rates and that the organization wants the rate review rule to be strong. Similarly, comments from Consumer’s Council of Missouri, Missouri Health Advocacy Alliance, the Missouri Budget Project, Women’s Voices Raised for Social Justice, Saint Louis University Center for Health Law Studies, and Missouri Health Care for All also indicated their appreciation for increased transparency for consumers.
RESPONSE: The Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration appreciates the comments from Empower Missouri, Consumer’s Council of Missouri, the Missouri Health Advocacy Alliance, the Missouri Budget Project, Women’s Voices Raised for Social Justice, Saint Louis University Center for Health Law, and Missouri Health Care for All.
COMMENT #2: Pam Rich, on behalf of Empower Missouri, com- mented that in order to allow the public to weigh in on significant increases, the rule should require that the director be required to hold a hearing for rate increases which exceed twenty percent (20%). Cara Spencer, on behalf of Consumers Council of Missouri, Lhakpa Tsering, on behalf of the Missouri Health Advocacy Alliance, Brian Colby on behalf of the Missouri Budget Project, and Alison Hile and Linda Zazove on behalf of Women’s Voices Raised for Social Justice, all joined Empower Missouri’s comments, and further recommended that hearings be considered for rate increases above ten percent (10%), suggesting that having public hearings for rate increases above a concrete threshold would ensure a deeper review of signifi- cant increases.
RESPONSE: The department does not have statutory authority to include such a requirement in this rule. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #3: Pam Rich, on behalf of Empower Missouri, com- mented that the rule should require the department to make rate fil- ings public on the department’s website. Several other commenters, including Women’s Voices Raised for Social Justice, the Missouri Budget Project, Missouri Health Advocacy Alliance, and Consumers Council of Missouri made similar comments.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Section (10) will be changed to clarify the department’s intent with regard to mak- ing rates public.
COMMENT #4: Cara Spencer, on behalf of Consumers Council of Missouri, commented that the department should make determina- tions about whether information submitted to the department in a rate filing should be considered confidential, rather than the health carri- er making that determination. Comments submitted by Sidney Watson, on behalf of Saint Louis University Center for Health Law and Missouri Health Care for All, also echoed this recommendation. RESPONSE: The process referenced in the rule is consistent with the process used for confidential trade secret information submitted to the department for all other lines of insurance. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #5: Cara Spencer, on behalf of Consumers Council of Missouri, as well as comments from the Missouri Budget Project, Empower Missouri, Women’s Voices Raised for Social Justice, and the Missouri Health Advocacy Alliance recommended that the defin-
ition of “unreasonable rate” be more clearly defined in order to pro- vide notice to the public. Several commenters also noted that notifi- cation of unreasonable rate determinations should be made public by posting on the department’s website, and that carriers should also be required to post the information on their own websites. RESPONSE: The department appreciates these comments. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #6: Cara Spencer, on behalf of Consumers Council of Missouri, commented that in order to fully understand the rate justi- fication and properly review proposed rates, carriers should be required to show the basis for the assumptions relied on in their jus- tifications, and that the evidence demonstrating those assumptions is reasonable.
RESPONSE: The department’s existing regulatory processes for reviewing and analyzing rate filings allow the department to analyze the basis of the carriers’ assumptions and request clarification when necessary. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment.
COMMENT #7: Sidney Watson, on behalf of Saint Louis University Center for Health Law and Missouri Health Care for All, commented that the rule should include a minimum time for public comment. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Section (11) will be changed to include a minimum time for public comments.
COMMENT #8: Sidney Watson, on behalf of Saint Louis University Center for Health Law Studies and Missouri HealthCare for All, commented that the rule should require the department to make pub- lic comments received available for review on its website. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: Section (11) will be changed to clarify that comments received will be accessible to the public through the department’s website.
20 CSR 400-13.100 Health Insurance Rates
