HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO 
RULES 
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system– 
Title Division Chapter Rule 
3 CSR 10- 4 .115 Department Code of Agency General area Specific area 
State Division regulated regulated Regulations 
and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115. 
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a. 
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation, for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115 NOT Rule 10-4.115. Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated.

November 15, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 22 
Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 19—DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SENIOR SERVICES Division 20—Division of Community and Public Health Chapter 1—Food Protection 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 19 CSR 20-1.040 Good Manufacturing Practices. The department 
is amending sections (1) and (2). 
PURPOSE: This amendment updates state food manufacturing stan- dards to be consistent with the U.S Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) current good manufacturing practices regulation. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) regulates food manufacturers and ware- houses in collaboration with the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To that end, DHSS strives to maintain consis- tency with its federal partners to minimize hardships on industry by utilizing federal regulations and program standards. The core regu- lation governing food manufacturers and warehouses is known as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). In 2013, DHSS adopted FDA’s GMPs found in 21 CFR 110 by reference. On September 17, 2015, FDA published updated GMPs (21 CFR 117). FDA implement- ed staggered compliance dates for affected businesses. Small busi- nesses (those with less than five hundred (500) full-time employees) were given two (2) years to comply with the new GMPs. Very small 
businesses (businesses averaging less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per year (adjusted for inflation) in annual sales of human food plus the market value of human food manufactured, processed, packed, or held without sale) were given three (3) years to comply. FDA requires states that conduct contract inspections either adopt equivalent regulations or inspect under federal authori- ty. DHSS has not adopted the updated GMPs and is currently con- ducting FDA-contract and non-contract inspections under the previ- ous GMPs found in 21 CFR 110. The majority of Missouri food man- ufacturers and warehouses are considered small businesses and are now required to comply with the new federal GMPs. Updating this rule to include incorporation of the new GMP regulation by reference will 1) reduce industry and government confusion regarding the most applicable set of GMPs; 2) reduce industry cost of complying with two (2) sets of GMPs; 3) ensure consistency between federal and state regulatory agencies; and 4) allow the state program to continue inspecting under its own authority, thus allowing the state program to make its own decisions with regards to information sharing and enforcement. This emergency amendment is necessary to protect industry and governmental interest as federal regulations, adopted by reference by DHSS, have been modernized. Failure to adopt the updated regulations at the state level will create a situation in which industry is required to comply with new regulations at the federal level as well as dated regulations at the state level, adding undue bur- den and cost to the food industry. As a result, DHSS finds a com- pelling governmental interest, which requires this emergency action. A proposed amendment, which covers the same material, is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. The scope of this emergency amendment is limited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. DHSS believes this emergency amend- ment is fair to all interested persons and parties under the circum- stances. This emergency amendment was filed October 13, 2017, becomes effective October 23, 2017, and expires April 20, 2018. 
(1) Applicability. The requirements of this rule apply to buildings or facilities, or parts thereof, used for, or in connection with, the man- ufacturing, packaging, [transporting] processing, or holding of human food. 
(2) Standards. Manufacturers, distributors, and warehouses shall operate in accordance with 21 CFR Part [110] 117 Current Good Manufacturing Practice [in Manufacturing, Packing, or Holding], Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food, revised as of [April 1, 2012] September 17, 2015, hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this rule as published by the U.S. Government [Printing] Publishing Office, 732 North Capitol Street NW, Washington, DC 20401-0001, (202) 512-1800, http://bookstore.gpo.gov. This rule does not incorporate any subse- quent amendments or additions. 
AUTHORITY: sections 192.006, 192.020, and 196.045, [RSMo 2000, and section 192.020,] RSMo [Supp. 2012] 2016. This rule was previously filed as 13 CSR 50-70.010. Original rule entitled Missouri Division of Health E 1.20 was filed Nov. 17, 1949, effective Nov. 27, 1949. Rescinded and readopted: Filed March 11, 2013, effective Sept. 30, 2013. Emergency amendment filed Oct. 13, 2017, effective Oct. 23, 2017, expires April 20, 2018. A proposed amend- ment covering this same material is published in this issue of the Missouri Register.

Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder. Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]

Proposed Rules 
November 15, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 22 
(3) Commencement. A small utility rate case may be commenced by— 
(A) A letter received by the secretary of the commission from a small utility stating the amount of the requested increase in its overall annual operating revenues. 
1. Any such letter need not be accompanied by any proposed tariff revisions. 
2. Upon receipt of the letter, the secretary of the commission will cause a rate case to be opened and will file a copy of the letter in that case. 
3. At any time before day one hundred fifty (150) of the timeline described in section (5) of this rule, the utility may submit to the sec- retary of the commission a letter withdrawing its previous request for an increase in its annual operating revenues. Upon receipt of such a letter, the secretary of the commission will close the rate case; 
(B) A complaint filed by staff or by any eligible entity or entities pursuant to section 386.390.1, RSMo, or section 393.260.1, RSMo; and 
(C) A proposed tariff stating a new rate or charge filed by a small utility pursuant to section 393.150.1, RSMo. 
(4) Staff will assist a small utility in processing a small utility rate case insofar as the assistance is consistent with staff’s function and responsibilities to the commission. 
(5) Rate Case Timeline. Within one (1) week after a small utility rate case is opened, staff will file a timeline under which the case will proceed, specifying due dates for the activities required by this rule. 
(A) Staff and the utility may agree in writing that the deadlines set out in the rate case timeline be extended for up to thirty (30) days. If an extension is agreed upon, staff shall file the agreement and an updated timeline reflecting the extension in the case file. 
(6) Local public hearing. A local public hearing shall be scheduled to occur no later than sixty (60) days after the opening of the case unless staff files a notice in the case stating that all parties agree a local public hearing is not necessary. 
(7) Notice. At least ten (10) days prior to a local public hearing, or upon the filing of a notice that a local public hearing is not necessary, the utility shall mail a written notice, as approved by staff and the office of the public counsel (OPC), to its customers stating— 
(A) The time, date, and location of the local public hearing, con- sistent with the order setting the hearing, if applicable; 
(B) A summary of the proposed rates and charges, the effect of the proposed rate increase on an average residential customer’s bill, and any other company requests that may affect customers, if known; 
(C) An invitation to submit comments about the utility’s rates and quality of service within thirty (30) days after the date shown on the notice and instructions as to how comments can be submitted elec- tronically, by telephone, and in writing; 
(D) Instructions for viewing the publicly available filings made in the case via the commission’s electronic filing system; and 
(E) Staff will file a copy of the notice in the case file. 
(8) Investigation and audit. After a small utility rate case is opened, the staff shall, and the public counsel may, conduct an investigation of the utility’s request. 
(A) This investigation may include a review of any and all infor- mation and materials related to the utility’s cost of providing service and its operating revenues, the design of the utility’s rates, the utili- ty’s service charges or fees, all provisions of the utility’s tariffs, and any operational or customer service issues that are discovered during the investigation. The staff’s audit and investigation will follow staff internal procedures designed to ensure reasonable consistency in the recommended rate treatment of the utility’s rate base, revenue, and expenses with that of other similarly situated utilities. 
(B) The investigation may include a review of the records generat- 
ed since the utility’s previous rate case, the case in which the utility was granted its Certificate of Convenience and Necessity, or the util- ity’s transfer of assets case, whichever is most recent. 
(C) If an investigation of the utility’s request includes the submis- sion of data request to the utility, copies of the data requests shall be provided to all parties to the case when they are submitted to the util- ity. 
(D) The investigation shall include an update of the utility’s rate base. 
(E) In determining the utility’s cost of service, the value of normal expense items and plant-in-service and other rate base items, for which documentation is not available, may be based upon such evi- dence as is available or may be estimated in order to include reason- able levels of those costs. Unusual expense or rate base items, or expense or rate base items for which the utility claims unusual levels of cost may require additional support by the utility. Nothing in this section diminishes the utility’s obligation to adhere to the commis- sion’s rules regarding appropriate record-keeping. 
(F) Not later than ninety (90) days after a small utility rate case is opened, the staff, and the public counsel, if conducting its own investigation, shall provide to all parties a report of its preliminary investigation, audit, analysis, and workpapers including: 
1. An evaluation of the utility’s record-keeping practices; and 
2. A list of the cost of service items that are still under consid- eration with an explanation for why those items are not yet resolved. 
(9) Settlement proposals. (A) Staff’s confidential settlement proposal. Not later than one 
hundred twenty (120) days after a small utility rate case is opened, staff, and the public counsel, if conducting its own investigation, shall provide to all parties to the case a confidential settlement pro- posal as follows: 
1. Staff’s settlement proposal will address the following sub- jects: 
A. The utility’s annual operating revenues; B. The utility’s customer rates; C. The utility’s service charges and fees; D. The utility’s plant depreciation rates; E. The utility’s tariff provisions; 
F. The operation of the utility’s systems; and 
G. The management of the utility’s operations; 2. Staff’s settlement proposal will include the following docu- 
ments: A. Draft revised tariff sheets reflecting the settlement propos- 
al; B. A draft disposition agreement reflecting the settlement 
proposal; C. Staff’s updated workpapers; and D. Any other documents supporting the staff’s settlement 
proposal; 3. OPC’s settlement proposal will address the following sub- 
jects: A. The utility’s annual operating revenues; B. The utility’s customer rates; C. If applicable, the utility’s service charges and fees; D. The utility’s plant depreciation rates; and 
4. OPC’s settlement proposal will include the following docu- ments: 
A. OPC’s updated workpapers; and 
B. Any other documents supporting OPC’s settlement pro- posal. 
(B) Any settlement proposal, including any draft disposition agree- ment, and all supporting documents attached thereto are strictly intended for settlement negotiations only. If staff and the utility are unable to reach a full or partial settlement via disposition agreement, neither party is bound to any position stated or implied by the settle- ment proposal, draft disposition agreement, or supporting documents provided.

(C) Not later than ten (10) days after staff provides its settlement proposal, the public counsel, the utility, and any other parties to the case shall notify staff whether they agree with the proposal or, if not, provide any suggested changes and the reasoning for those changes to the parties. Any party suggesting changes shall provide to all other parties any audit workpapers, rate design workpapers, or other doc- uments in its possession that support its suggestions. 
(10) At any time prior to the filing of a disposition agreement, any party may request the assigned regulatory law judge meet with the participants and mediate discussions to assist them in reaching at least a partial agreement.

A disposition agreement between at least staff and the utility providing for a partial resolution of the small utility rate case and a motion requesting that the case proceed to an evidentiary hearing; or 3. A motion stating that agreements cannot be reached on any of the issues related to the small utility rate case and asking that the

ty’s customers and will suspend the utility’s pending tariff revisions, if any, pending completion of the hearing.

Title 7—DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Division 10—Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission Chapter 17—Supplemental Guide Sign Program 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
7 CSR 10-17.050 [Requirements for] Logo Signing. The Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission is amending the title, sec- tions (1) through (8). 
PURPOSE: This amendment proposes the elimination of unnecessary restrictive words, reinstating the minimum attendance requirement that was inadvertently left out of the current rule when it was previ- ously amended, clarification language pertaining to logo display for gas/convenience stores, and editorial changes for clarity. 
(1) To participate in the Logo signing program, [A]a qualified entity must be a tourist attraction or provide one (1) or more of the following services: gas, food, lodging, camping, twenty-four- (24-) hour pharmacy, [or be a tourist attraction meeting the criteria found in this rule to be eligible to participate in the Logo signing program] and have a minimum annual attendance of five thousand (5,000) visitors in a consecutive twelve- (12-) month period. 
(A) Specific service signs shall be erected only for a qualified entity located within three (3) miles of the interchange as measured along the path from the interchange to the qualified entity. The measurement starting from the intersecting centerlines of the freeway and crossroad at the interchange to the nearest edge of the business structure project- ed at a right angle to the roadway centerline. If the capacity of the existing individual service sign for a specific business is not fully uti- lized, a successive three- (3-) mile increment may be considered for that specific type business on a temporary basis until the space is requested by a qualified entity within the initial three- (3-) mile dis- tance. The qualified entity occupying the space on a temporary basis will remain in place to the end of its annual participation agreement. Existing signs shall not be made larger or new signs installed to make room for qualified entities beyond the initial three- (3-) mile distance. The maximum distance allowed for each category from the inter- change is equal to— 
1. Gas, food, and lodging services - six (6) miles; 
2. Camping services or tourist attractions - fifteen (15) miles; and 
3. Twenty-four- (24-) hour pharmacies - three (3) miles. (B) Locations for mainline, ramp, and trailblazer signs [must] 
will be approved by the department. (C) Messages, symbols, and trademarks which resemble any offi- 
cial traffic control device [shall] are not to be used. (D) If Logo spaces for any of the service categories mentioned in this rule remain available, then the department, at its discretion, may permit other qualifying entities in the same service category meeting the majority of the criteria to utilize the otherwise unused spaces. Those qualified entities that participate, but do not fully qualify for the program, [shall] will be reevaluated on an annual basis. At that time, should there be a request from a fully qualifying entity to par- ticipate, the fully qualifying entity [shall] will be given priority over a less than fully qualifying entity when considering renewal of con- 
tracts. 
(2) When more than six (6) qualified entities of the same motorist service type wish to participate in the Logo program at the same interchange, up to six (6) Logo panels for this motorist service type may be installed, or roll over, onto a second specific service sign if the second specific service sign is empty or can be subdivided as stated in the supplemental signing program rules. No more than twelve (12) Logo panels for one (1) type of motorist service [shall] will be displayed at a single interchange on a maximum of two (2) specific service signs. The qualified entities occupying space on the second specific service sign may remain in place until such time as the space is needed by other qualified entities of other motor service types not currently displayed at the interchange choose to participate in the Logo program at that interchange. When this occurs, the qual- ified entities which rolled over onto the second specific service will remain in place until their participation agreement expires. 
(3) If the requests to place Logo panels on specific service signs exceed the available space, the following criteria [shall] will be used to determine the allocation of spaces: 
(B) The first six (6) qualified applicants for gas, food, lodging, camping, tourist attractions, and pharmacies [shall] will be selected to place their Logo panels on the specific service sign. When a tourist attraction and another motor service type are combined on a single specific service sign, the first three (3) qualified tourist attrac- tions and first three (3) of the other motor service type that share the same specific service sign [shall] will be selected; 
(C) Once all allowed similar type businesses are posted on the spe- cific service sign at an interchange, other similar type businesses that are on the waiting list that are closer to the interchange [shall] will have priority over the business furthest from the interchange that is also on the waiting list; and 
(4) If trailblazer signs are [required] needed for qualified entities, they [shall] will be installed at the same time or prior to the instal- lation of the Logo panel on the mainline and ramp signs. The pro- gram manager [shall] will determine if trailblazer signs are neces- sary, and the department will approve locations, if appropriate. 
(5) Where both Tourist Oriented Directional Signing (TODS) and Logo trailblazer signing would be needed at the same intersection, the TODS signs [shall] will incorporate the needed information from, and be used in place of, the Logo trailblazer sign. 
(6) Mainline Logo signs [shall] will be located on the freeway main- line between the first advanced guide sign and the exit guide sign. 
(7) Ramp signs [shall] will be located along the freeway interchange ramp after the gore and before the ramp terminal. 
(8) Logo panels [shall] will be constructed and installed as follows: (A) Only a qualified entity’s name, brand name, trademark, corpo- rate logo, or commercial symbol shall be used. Logo and word mes- sages shall not both be displayed on the Logo unless otherwise permit- ted in this rule. If a nationally, regionally, or locally recognized com- mercial symbol, corporate logo, or trademark is available, it should be used in preference to any other form of business identification. The department has the right to review and approve or deny the requested 
design— 1. The logo panel for a gas station/convenience store may display 
names, brand names, trademarks, corporate logos, commercial sym- bols, or other words, signs or symbols representing the brand of motor fuel and the convenience store name so long as the same or substan- tially similar words, signs, or symbols are permanently displayed on the business and are the same or substantially similar to the business name, business entity, or the doing business as “dba” name as regis- tered with the Missouri Secretary of State’s office. If the fuel brand name is different than the convenience store name, the fuel brand shall be displayed in the predominate position (top or left of the

logo panel) and represent no less than fifty percent (50%) of the logo area; and 
2. The federal regulation on this issue, as interpreted by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) guidance, suggests that blended logo panels are not allowed; however, the language of the federal reg- ulation appears to allow this compromise so long as both logos are contained in the business name, business entity, or “dba.” 
(B) Logo panels [shall] cannot display a message which advertis- es a product rather than identifying a business. Any exception must be approved by the department. On gas Logo panels, diesel, ethanol or E-85, Biodiesel or B20, Compressed Natural Gas or CNG, Propane, or Food Mart text may be included as a secondary message in the lower portion of the Logo panel; and
