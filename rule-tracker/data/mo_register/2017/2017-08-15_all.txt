Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]

PURPOSE: This amendment sets forth the extent to which modular unit dealers are responsible for proper initial setup of modular units, modifies the submission requirements for property locators and the assessment of fees associated with property locators, and provides for a waiver for good cause shown. 
(1) Modular Unit Dealer Setup. [(1)](A) A dealer who sells a modular unit shall arrange for the 
proper initial setup of the modular unit unless the dealer obtains from the purchaser or the purchaser’s authorized agent a written waiver of that service as described in section 700.100.3(6), RSMo. 
[(2)](B) As used in this rule, “proper initial setup” means instal- lation and setup of the modular unit in accordance with the installa- tion manual provided by the manufacturer of the modular unit and in complete compliance with the code and with all of the provisions regarding setup in sections 700.010 to 700.115, RSMo. 
(C) If a dealer, unless the dealer obtains the waiver of initial setup referred to in subsection (A) above, fails to arrange for the proper initial setup of a modular unit, the commission may dis- cipline the dealer’s registration by suspending it, revoking it, or placing it on probation, pursuant to the provisions of section 700.100, RSMo, if the manager provides evidence to the commis- sion, incident to an inspection, of setup deficiencies and initiates action to discipline the registration within two (2) years after the delivery date of a modular unit. 
(2) Modular Unit Inspections. (A) Dealers shall submit to the manufactured housing and 
modular units program a property locator indicating the destina- tion of the new residential modular unit(s) or new or used class- room modular unit(s) within five (5) business days to the date the unit leaves the dealer’s location or the manufacturer’s location if the unit is shipped direct to the consumer. For multi-section new residential or new or used classroom modular unit(s) the five (5) business days begins when the first section leaves the dealer’s or manufacturer’s location. The dealer shall use the property loca- tor form provided by the manufactured housing and modular units program. 
1. The manager shall assess a fifty dollar ($50) per home inspection fee to dealers who fail to submit the property locator within five (5) business days from the due date. 
2.

The applicable testing method and appropriate test probe are described in ASTM Standard D2573-94, or equiv- alent method. If no soil classification test is performed for the anchor location, then the soil at the location shall be considered as unclassified.

(A) Tables (A) through (C), included herein, illustrate the strap spacing for single section and multi-section homes with anchors located in classified and unclassified soils. 
1. Note that the maximum vertical distance is measured from the anchor head to the top of the I-beam (i.e., bottom of the floor). 2. The maximum distance to the first tie-down strap at each end 
of the home shall be two feet (2'0"). 3. Strap spacing calculations are based on the fact that single 
disk anchors and double disk anchors have the same holding capacity if installed in accordance with the anchor [manufacturer’s instal- lation instructions] manufacturer’s installation manual and in the proper soil classification. 
4. Anchors shall be installed just inside the skirting line in order to maintain the angles identified in each table.

(5) Within ten (10) days of the dispute resolution, the [director] manager shall send to the parties a final inspection report that iden- tifies which party has been determined by the [director] manager to be responsible for repairing the items originally in dispute.

(7) If the repairs are not completed by the original or duly-extended deadline, the [director may] staff counsel’s office shall send a demand letter to the delinquent manufacturer, dealer, and/or installer. If the repairs are not completed by the date specified in the demand letter, or as duly-extended by the staff counsel’s office in consultation with the manager, the manager shall file a formal complaint with the commission. 
(8) In any case where a deficiency is determined by the manager to be an imminent safety hazard or to constitute a serious struc- tural defect, the manager may file a request asking the commis- sion for an immediate hearing of the dispute.
