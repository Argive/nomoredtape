Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 40—Family Support Division Chapter 2—Income Maintenance 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
13 CSR 40-2.030 Definitions Relating to Real and Personal Property. The division is amending sections (7)–(10) and (12) and renumbering thereafter. 
PURPOSE: This amendment provides for updates to the asset limits that define the real and personal property considered in determining eligibility for assistance and how the value of that property is deter- mined. 
(7) In those programs applying the OAA, PTD criteria, in GR cases, and in Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) cases, in certain instances as defined in sections (8)—[(12)](13) of this rule, the property will be considered as a resource which the applicant or recipient can and should use in meeting his/her needs and will not be eligible for public assistance. (Original rule filed Feb. 6, 1975, effec- tive Feb. 16, 1975.) The eligibility factor of property as an available resource applies under the OAA criteria to an applicant, recipient, and spouse. In AFDC cases, the policy applies to a child and to a parent(s) or, as allowed by federal law or regulation, to stepparents or, if included in the grant, a needy nonparent caretaker relative or legal guardian with whom the child is living. In cases receiving GR, the policy applies to an applicant or recipient and spouse and chil- dren in the home under the age of twenty-one (21). If the GR appli- cant or recipient is under age twenty-one (21), it applies to his/her parent(s) in the home. In programs applying the PTD criteria, the

policy applies to the applicant or recipient and spouse. (Original rule filed Nov. 3, 1950, effective Nov. 13, 1950. Amended: Oct. 20, 1967, effective Oct. 30, 1967. Amended: July 8, 1969, effective July 18, 1969. Amended: Feb. 6, 1975, effective Feb. 16, 1975.) 
(8) When an applicant or recipient of programs applying the OAA, PTD, or Aid to the Blind (AB) criteria [or GR], or the spouse with whom s/he lives [or, when the GR applicant or recipient is under age twenty-one (21), the parent(s) with whom s/he lives,] owns real property which is not furnishing shelter for him/her, [and] its current market value [is one thousand dollars ($1000) or more if owned by a single person or more than two thousand dollars ($2000) if owned by a married person living with spouse, it shall be considered as a resource and the claimant will not be eligible for assistance on the basis of need; provided, all of the following criteria which apply are met (the value of an equity in a life estate and of burial lots shall be excluded from this computation). In GR cases involving two (2) or more persons eligible for GR, the limita- tion will be more than two thousand dollars ($2000).] shall be considered an available asset and subject to the limits of sec- tion (12) of this regulation. When an applicant or recipient of programs applying the OAA, PTD, or AB criteria is under age eighteen (18) and the parent(s) with whom s/he lives owns real property which is not furnishing shelter for him/her, its current market value shall be considered an available asset and subject to the limits of section (12) of this regulation. For GR, when an applicant or recipient or the spouse with whom s/he lives owns real property which is not furnishing shelter for him/her, its cur- rent market value shall be considered an available asset and sub- ject to the limits of section (13) of this regulation. When an appli- cant or recipient of GR is under age twenty-one (21) and the par- ent(s) with whom s/he lives owns real property which is not fur- nishing shelter for him/her, its current market value shall be con- sidered an available asset and subject to the limits of section (13) of this regulation. In programs applying the OAA, PTD, AB cri- teria, or GR, the claimant will not be eligible for assistance on the basis of need; provided, all of the following criteria which apply are met (the value of an equity in a life estate and of burial lots shall be excluded from this computation). For AFDC cases, the limitation will be one thousand dollars ($1000), except that burial lots must be excluded from this computation. If the value of real property [is less than the amounts stated previously,] does not exceed the asset limits of section (12) or (13) of the rule, it shall be counted as a part of the combination of available resources in determining eligibility[, as stated in section (12) of this rule]. 
(9) A single individual applying for or receiving assistance in pro- grams applying the OAA or PTD criteria who owns insurance (over and above the first one thousand five hundred dollars ($1500) in face value) with a cash or loan value of one thousand dollars ($1000) or more through June 30, 2017, will not be considered eligible for assistance on the basis of available resources. Effective July 1, 2017, the cash or loan value in excess of the one thousand five hundred dollars ($1500) shall be considered an available asset and subject to the limits of section (12) of this regulation. A husband or wife living together may own insurance (over and above the first one thou- sand five hundred dollars ($1500) each in face value) in any combi- nation with a total cash or loan value up to and including two thou- sand dollars ($2000) through June 30, 2017. Effective July 1, 2017, the cash or loan value in excess of the one thousand five hundred dollars ($1500) for each spouse shall be considered an available asset and subject to the limits of section (12) of this reg- ulation. In GR cases, the one thousand five hundred dollar ($1500) face value exemption will apply to each person included in the GR case. When the claimant has deposited money with an individual, firm, or corporation as an advance payment for a funeral and the pay- ment is safeguarded by burial insurance, trust fund or joint bank 
account, the amount of money over one thousand five hundred dol- lars ($1500) deposited under such a plan will be considered a resource in the same manner as the cash or loan value of life insur- ance policies, if the contract is revocable. If the burial/funeral con- tract is irrevocable, the entire amount of money deposited will be excluded from available resources. If the claimant has both life insur- ance and prepaid burial (revocable or irrevocable), the one thousand five hundred dollar ($1500) exemption will apply to either or to any combination. The face value of an irrevocable burial contract will always be counted toward the one thousand five hundred dollar ($1500) exemption. If the cash or loan value of insurance is less than the amounts stated in this section, it shall be counted as part of the combination of available resources in determining eligibility as stated in section (12) for OAA or PTD, or in section (13) for GR of this rule. An individual applying for or receiving assistance in programs applying the OAA or PTD criteria may designate separately identifi- able funds as set aside for burial for the individual or spouse up to a maximum of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1500). The amount of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1500) shall be reduced by— 1) the total face value of insurance policies on the life of the individ- ual or spouse which are owned by him/her or his/her spouse, the cash surrender value of which has been excluded in determining eli- gibility on available resources as provided in this section and in sec- tion (12) for OAA or PTD, or in section (13) for GR of this rule and 2) the value of any burial/funeral contract on the life of the indi- vidual or spouse. When this fund has been designated and all or a portion is excluded in determining available resources eligibility as provided in this section and in section (12) for OAA or PTD, or sec- tion (13) for GR of this rule, the interest or appreciation to the excluded portion of this fund (if left to accumulate) also shall be excluded in determining available resources eligibility, starting with interest or appreciation accrued on or after the beginning date of Medicaid eligibility. In AFDC cases, there shall be disregarded any prearranged funeral or burial contract, or any two (2) or more con- tracts, which provides for the payment of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1500) or less per family member. The face value of an irrevocable burial contract will always be counted toward the one thousand five hundred dollar ($1500) exemption. In AFDC cases, any family who owns revocable prepaid burials (over and above the first one thousand five hundred dollars ($1500) in equity value) or insurance with cash surrender value over one thousand dollars ($1000) will not be eligible for assistance. If the cash surrender value of revocable prepaid burials (over and above the first one thousand five hundred dollars ($1500) in equity value) or insurance is one thousand dollars ($1000) or less, it shall be counted as a part of the combination of available resources in determining eligibility as stated in section [(12)] (13) of this rule. (Original rule filed Jan. 1, 1952, effective Jan. 10, 1952. Amended: July 29, 1959, effective Aug. 29, 1959. Amended: Oct. 19, 1959, effective Oct. 29, 1959. Amended: July 8, 1969, effective July 18, 1969. Amended: July 23, 1970, effec- tive Aug. 2, 1970. Amended: Dec. 22, 1972, effective Jan. 1, 1973.) 
(10) In programs applying the OAA, PTD, or AB criteria, and GR cases, salable personal property, such as livestock, farm surplus, jewelry (except wedding and engagement rings owned by claimant or spouse), machinery, automobiles and trucks, and the like, shall be considered as an available resource when the following criteria are present: 
(A) In programs applying the OAA, PTD, or AB criteria, and GR cases, the equity based on current market value is one thousand dol- lars ($1000) or more, or more than two thousand dollars ($2000) in the case of a married person living with spouse. In GR cases involv- ing two (2) or more persons eligible for GR, the limitation is more than two thousand dollars ($2000). Effective July 1, 2017, the equi- ty value for programs applying the OAA, PTD, or AB criteria shall be considered an available asset and subject to the limits of section (12) of this rule; 
(C) Household furnishings shall not be considered as available

resources unless they are not being used by the applicant, in which case [the limits of one thousand dollar ($1000) value will apply] they are subject to the limitations in section (12) for OAA, PTD, or AB criteria, and section (13) for GR; [and] 
(D) Effective July 1, 2017, in programs applying the OAA, PTD, or AB criteria, the first five thousand dollars ($5000) of medical savings accounts and independent living accounts shall be limited to deposits of earned income and earnings on that income while the individual is a participant; and 
[(D)](E) If the value of the personal property is less than the amounts stated in subsections (10)(A)—[(C)](D), it shall be counted as a part of the combination of available resources in determining eli- gibility as stated in section (12) for OAA, PTD, or AB, or section (13) for GR of this rule. (Original rule filed Jan. 11, 1952, effective Jan. 21, 1952. Amended: Dec. 3, 1952, effective Dec. 13, 1952. Amended: July 29, 1959, effective Aug. 29, 1959. Amended: Oct. 19, 1959, effective Oct. 29, 1959. Amended: July 8, 1969, effective July 18, 1969. Amended: July 23, 1970, effective Aug. 2, 1970. Amended: Dec. 22, 1972, effective Jan. 1, 1973.) 
(12) [In programs applying the OAA, PTD criteria and GR cases, a]Any combination of available resources—real property, personal property, cash or securities, or cash surrender or loan value of life insurance (including money deposited in revocable prepaid burials)[, the combined value of which is one thousand dol- lars ($1000) or more, will result in ineligibility for a single person. For a married person living with spouse, any combi- nation of available resources which exceeds a value of two thousand dollars ($2000) will result in ineligibility for both persons.] shall be considered in regards to the asset limits set below. The following asset limits apply to every MHABD pro- gram, except Blind Pension, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment program, and the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) or Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB) programs: 
(A) This subsection identifies the asset limits for MHABD before July 1, 2017. 
1. A household that is applying for or receiving MHABD on the basis of being over age sixty-five (65) or permanently and totally disabled does not qualify for MHABD if— 
A. It is a one- (1-) person household, and the household has countable assets of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more; or B. It is a two- (2-) person household, and the household 
has countable assets of two thousand dollars ($2,000) or more. 2. A household that is applying for or receiving MHABD on 
the basis of being blind does not qualify for MHABD if— A. It is a one- (1-) person household, and the household has countable assets of two thousand dollars ($2,000) or more; or B. It is a two- (2-) person household, and the household 
has countable assets of four thousand dollars ($4,000) or more; (B) Effective July 1, 2017, a household is not eligible for MHABD, regardless of whether eligibility is determined based on age, blindness, or permanent and total disability, if it has count- 
able assets at or in excess of the following limits: 
(C) Effective July 1, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2022), the asset limit identified in section (5) of this rule shall increase every July thereafter at the same rate as the increase in the cost-of-living percentage of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), or its successor, as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor. The asset limit shall be rounded to the nearest five cents (5¢). 
1. The percentage increase shall be based on changes in the CPI-U between July of two (2) years prior to the year in which the current fiscal year begins, and July of the immediately pre- ceding year. 
A. Example: To determine the asset limit for Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22), the department shall measure the increase in the CPI-U between July 2019 and July 2020. If the CPI-U increased by one percent (1%) during that period, the asset limit for FY22 shall also increase by one percent (1%); and 
(D) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a person is not eligible for QMB or SLMB if the person’s household has countable assets in excess of the maximum resource level applied for the applicable year under 42 U.S.C. section 1395w- 114(a)(3)(D), pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1396d(p)(1)(C). 
(13) In GR cases, any combination of one thousand dollars ($1000) or more for the applicant or recipient of GR would make that person ineligible (except that a husband and wife or two (2) or more persons in the household eligible for GR could have up to two thousand dol- lars ($2000) together). In AFDC cases, any combination of more than one thousand dollars ($1000) would make the family ineligible. (Original rule filed Jan. 11, 1952, effective Jan. 21, 1952. Amended: July 29, 1959, effective Aug. 29, 1959. Amended: Oct. 19, 1959, effective Oct. 29, 1959. Amended: July 8, 1969, effective July 18, 1969. Amended: July 23, 1970, effective Aug. 2, 1970.) 
[(13)](14) Notwithstanding the previously mentioned eligibility requirements with respect to resources, the following will apply to individuals meeting the definition of institutionalized spouses who begin a period of continuous institutionalization on or after September 30, 1989: 
(A) As used in this section, the definitions for the following terms shall apply: 
1. Assessment shall mean a determination by the FSD of the total equity value of available resources (as stated in sections (6)- [(12)](13)) owned by the institutionalized spouse, the community spouse, or both, which may be requested at the beginning of a period of continuous institutionalization expected to last at least thirty (30) days or more; 
2. Community spouse shall mean the husband or wife of an institutionalized spouse who does not reside in a medical hospital or a Medicaid-certified bed in a nursing facility (NF) and, if the insti- tutionalized spouse is one who meets the definition in subparagraph [(13)](14)(A)3.C., the community spouse may not be one who meets those criteria; 
3. Institutionalized spouse shall mean a claimant who resides in— 
A. A medical hospital;

4. Period of continuous institutionalization shall mean a stay in a medical hospital or Medicaid-certified bed in an NF or when the Division of Disability and Senior Services determines a need for home- and community-based waiver services which is expected to last thirty (30) days or more; and 
(B) The following shall apply with regard to resource eligibility for institutionalized spouses who begin a period of continuous institu- tionalization on or after September 30, 1989: 
1. When an individual meets the criteria in subparagraph [(13)](14)(A)3.C., his/her gross monthly income shall be compared to one thousand twelve dollars ($1,012). If his/her gross monthly income is equal to or less than one thousand twelve dollars ($1,012),

At the beginning of the first period of continuous institution- alization, the institutionalized spouse, the community spouse, or a representative acting on behalf of either may request an assessment by the FSD of total equity in available resources owned by either or both in the month in which the period of institutionalization began or, in the case of an institutionalized spouse who meets the definition in subparagraph [(13)](14)(A)3.C. and who met that definition prior to January 1, 1993, January 1993 shall be substituted for the month in which the period of institutionalization began; 
3. From this total, the FSD shall compute the spousal share, which shall be the greater of—1) twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) or 2) one-half (1/2) of the total, not to exceed sixty thousand dollars ($60,000). The twelve thousand dollar ($12,000) minimum and the sixty thousand dollar ($60,000) maximum shall be increased each January in accordance with the increase in the Consumer Price Index, beginning in 1990; 
4. In determining initial Medicaid eligibility for the institution- alized spouse in this continuous period of institutionalization, the FSD again shall determine the total equity in available resources owned by the institutionalized spouse, the community spouse, or both, at the time of Medicaid request. From this total, the FSD shall deduct the amount of the spousal share as computed in paragraphs [(13)](14)(B)2. and 3. If the remainder is equal to or less than the appropriate resource maximum for a single person, the institutional- ized individual, to the extent the individual expresses intent to trans- fer any excess resources to the community spouse, shall be initially eligible for Medicaid on the factor of available resources. Eligibility for Medicaid for individuals described in subparagraph [(13)](14)(A)3.C. who become resource eligible using the assess- ment described in paragraph [(13)](14)(B)2. cannot begin prior to the date the individual actually receives home- and community-based waiver services; 
5. Any such individual who is determined initially eligible for Medicaid must transfer any resources above the appropriate resource maximum which are held in the individual’s name to the community spouse within ninety (90) days of notification of initial eligibility, unless good cause exists; 
6. If good cause does not exist, the FSD shall consider any resources held in the name of the institutionalized spouse, including any jointly-owned resources, in determining continued Medicaid eli- gibility, effective ninety (90) days after notification of initial eligibil- ity; 
7. After the determination of initial eligibility for the institution- alized spouse, no resources of the community spouse not jointly owned with the institutionalized spouse shall be considered available to the institutionalized spouse in Medicaid determinations in that continuous period of institutionalization; 
8. If either spouse establishes in a fair hearing that the spousal share (in relation to the amount of income generated by that amount) is inadequate to raise the community spouse’s own income to the amount determined in 13 CSR 40-2.200(5)(A), the spousal share may be adjusted to an amount adequate to provide the additional income. At the fair hearing the maximum amount of the institution- alized spouse’s income that may be made available to the community spouse under 42 U.S.C.1396r-5(d), shall be considered the commu- nity spouse’s own income; and 
9. If a court has entered an order against an institutionalized spouse for the support of the community spouse, the amount of the order shall be substituted for the spousal share.

Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 40—Family Support Division Chapter 8—MO HealthNet for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled 
PROPOSED RULE 13 CSR 40-8.020 Ways of Treating Income and Assets 
PURPOSE: This rule defines the asset limits, the ways in which assets are treated, in determining eligibility for MO HealthNet for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (MHABD), and programs with which MHABD coverage is provided. 
(1) Scope. This rule describes the general requirements related to how assets affect eligibility for MHABD. This regulation does not apply to the Blind Pension program pursuant to Chapter 209, RSMo 2016, unless noted otherwise. Any provisions in this rule control over similar provisions in 13 CSR 40-2.030, including, but not lim- ited to, the asset limits defined in that rule. 
(2) The division shall treat income and assets in a way that is no more restrictive than the way income and assets are treated for the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, with the exception of the asset limits described in section (4) of this rule, and as provided for in the Medicaid State Plan. 
(3) In determining eligibility for MHABD, the division shall consid- er— 
(A) Any kind of asset that is owned by a household member, or in the name of someone on behalf of the household member; 
(B) Any kind of asset that is owned by a trust or any other entity, but which a household member, or someone acting on behalf of a household member, has the legal power to use for the general benefit of the household; or 
(C) Any kind of asset that is owned by a self-settled trust, as defined in, determined by, and subject to the rules of 42 U.S.C. sec- tion 1396p(d). 
(4) The following asset limits apply to every MHABD program, except Blind Pension, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment pro- gram, and the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) or Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB) programs: 
(A) This subsection identifies the asset limits for MHABD before July 1, 2017. 
1. A household that is applying for or receiving MHABD on the basis of being over age sixty-five (65) or permanently and totally dis- abled does not qualify for MHABD if— 
A. It is a one- (1-) person household, and the household has countable assets of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more; or 
B. It is a two- (2-) person household, and the household has countable assets of two thousand dollars ($2,000) or more. 
2. A household that is applying for or receiving MHABD on the basis of being blind does not qualify for MHABD if— 
A. It is a one- (1-) person household, and the household has countable assets of two thousand dollars ($2,000) or more; or 
B. It is a two- (2-) person household, and the household has countable assets of four thousand dollars ($4,000) or more; 
(B) Effective July 1, 2017, a household is not eligible for MHABD, regardless of whether eligibility is determined based on age, blindness, or permanent and total disability, if it has countable assets at or in excess of the following limits: 
(C) Effective July 1, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2022), the asset limit iden- tified in section (4) of this rule shall increase every July thereafter at the same rate as the increase in the cost-of-living percentage of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), or its suc- cessor, as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor. The asset limit shall be rounded to the nearest five cents (5¢). 
1. The percentage increase shall be based on changes in the CPI-U between July of two (2) years prior to the year in which the current fiscal year begins and July of the immediately preceding year. 
A. Example: To determine the asset limit for Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22), the department shall measure the increase in the CPI- U between July 2019 and July 2020. If the CPI-U increased by one percent (1%) during that period, the asset limit for FY22 shall also increase by one percent (1%); 
(D) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a person is not eligible for QMB or SLMB if the person’s household has countable assets in excess of the maximum resource level applied for the applic- able year under 42 U.S.C. section 1395w-114(a)(3)(D), pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1396d(p)(1)(C). 
AUTHORITY: sections 207.022 and 660.017, RSMo 2016. Emergency rule filed June 20, 2017, effective July 1, 2017, expires Feb. 22, 2018. Original rule filed June 20, 2017. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rule will cost state agencies or polit- ical subdivisions $72,836,001 in Fiscal Year 2018 and the following for subsequent fiscal years– FY19: $146,832,345; FY20: $170,131,940; FY21: $187,814,828; FY22: $198,611,006 to the MO HealthNet Division. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed rule will not cost private entities more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this rule with the Department of Social Services, Rules.Comment@dss.mo.gov. To be considered, comments must be received within thirty (30) days after publication of this notice in the Missouri Register. No public hearing is scheduled.

Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 70—MO HealthNet Division Chapter 15—Hospital Program 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
13 CSR 70-15.010 Inpatient Hospital Services Reimbursement Plan; Outpatient Hospital Services Reimbursement Methodology. The division is amending subsections (3)(B) and (15)(B). 
PURPOSE: This amendment provides for updates to the calculation of the Direct Medicaid payments made on or after May 1, 2017. Additionally, this amendment provides for the State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2018 trend factor to be applied in determining Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA) funded hospital payments for SFY 2018. 
(3) Per Diem Reimbursement Rate Computation. Each hospital shall receive a MO HealthNet per diem rate based on the following com- putation: 
(B) Trend Indices (TI). Trend indices are determined based on the four- (4-) quarter average DRI Index for DRI-Type Hospital Market Basket as published in Health Care Costs by DRI/McGraw-Hill for each State Fiscal Year (SFY) 1995 to 1998. Trend indices starting in SFY 1999 will be determined based on CPI Hospital indexed as pub- lished in Health Care Costs by DRI/McGraw-Hill, or equivalent publication, regardless of any changes in the name of the publication or publisher, for each State Fiscal Year (SFY). Trend indices starting in SFY 2016 will be determined based on the Hospital Market Basket index as published in Healthcare Cost Review by Institute of Health Systems (IHS), or equivalent publication, regardless of any changes in the name of the publication or publisher, for each State Fiscal Year (SFY). 
1. The TI are— A. SFY 1994—4.6% B. SFY 1995—4.45% C. SFY 1996—4.575% D. SFY 1997—4.05% E. SFY 1998—3.1% F. SFY 1999—3.8% G. SFY 2000—4.0% H. SFY 2001—4.6% I. SFY 2002—4.8% J. SFY 2003—5.0% K. SFY 2004—6.2% L. SFY 2005—6.7% M. SFY 2006—5.7% N. SFY 2007—5.9% O. SFY 2008—5.5% P. SFY 2009—5.5% Q. SFY 2010—3.9% R. SFY 2011—3.2%—The 3.2% trend shall not be applied in 
determining the per diem rate, Direct Medicaid payments, or unin- sured payments. 
S. SFY 2012—4.0% T. SFY 2013—4.4% U. SFY 2014—3.7% V. SFY 2015—4.3% W. SFY 2016—2.5% X. SFY 2017—2.7% Y. SFY 2018—3.2% 
2. The TI for SFY 1996 through SFY 1998 are applied as a full percentage to the OC of the per diem rate and for SFY 1999 the OC of the June 30, 1998, rate shall be trended by 1.2% and for SFY 2000 the OC of the June 30, 1999, rate shall be trended by 2.4%. The OC of the June 30, 2000, rate shall be trended by 1.95% for SFY 2001. 
3. The per diem rate shall be reduced as necessary to avoid any 
negative Direct Medicaid payments computed in accordance with subsection (15)(B). 
4. A facility previously enrolled for participation in the MO HealthNet Program, which either voluntarily or involuntarily termi- nates its participation in the MO HealthNet Program and which reen- ters the MO HealthNet Program, will receive the same inpatient rate and outpatient rate as the previous owner/operator. Such facility will also receive the same Direct Medicaid Add-On Payment and Uninsured Add-On Payment as the previous owner/operator if the facility reenters the MO HealthNet Program during the same state fiscal year. If the facility does not reenter during the same state fis- cal year, the Direct Medicaid Add-On Payment and Uninsured Add- On Payment will be determined based on the applicable base year data (i.e., fourth prior year cost report for the Direct Medicaid Payment; see 13 CSR 70-15.220 for the applicable data for the Uninsured Add-On Payment). If the facility does not have the applic- able base year data, the Direct Medicaid Add-On Payment and the Uninsured Add-On Payment will be based on the most recent audited data available and will include annual trend factor adjustments from the year subsequent to the cost report period through the state fiscal year for which the payments are being determined. 
(15) Direct Medicaid Payments. (B) Direct Medicaid payment will be computed as follows: 
1. The MO HealthNet share of the inpatient FRA assessment will be calculated by dividing the hospital’s inpatient Medicaid patient days by the total inpatient hospital patient days from the hos- pital’s base cost report to arrive at the inpatient Medicaid utilization percentage. This percentage is then multiplied by the inpatient FRA assessment for the current SFY to arrive at the increased allowable MO HealthNet costs for the inpatient FRA assessment. The MO HealthNet share of the outpatient FRA assessment will be calculated by dividing the hospital’s outpatient MO HealthNet charges by the total outpatient hospital charges from the base cost report to arrive at the MO HealthNet utilization percentage. This percentage is then multiplied by the outpatient FRA assessment for the current SFY to arrive at the increased allowable MO HealthNet costs for the outpa- tient FRA assessment[;]. 
A. Effective for payments made on or after May 1, 2017, only the Fee-for-Service and Out-of-State components of the MO HealthNet share of both the inpatient and outpatient FRA assess- ment will be included in the Direct Medicaid add-on payment. 
2. The unreimbursed MO HealthNet costs are determined by subtracting the hospital’s per diem rate from its trended per diem costs. The difference is multiplied by the estimated MO HealthNet patient days for the current SFY plus the out-of-state days from the fourth prior year cost report trended to the current SFY. The estimat- ed MO HealthNet patient days for the current SFY shall be the better of the sum of the Fee-for-Service (FFS) days plus managed care days or the days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calcu- lation. The FFS days are determined from a regression analysis of the hospital’s FFS days from February 1999 through December of the second prior SFY. The managed care days are based on the FFS days determined from the regression analysis, as follows: The FFS days are factored up by the percentage of FFS days to the total of FFS days plus managed care days from the hospital’s fourth prior year cost report. The difference between the FFS days and the FFS days factored up by the FFS days’ percentage are the managed care days. 
A. Effective January 1, 2010, the estimated MO HealthNet patient days shall be the better of the sum of the FFS days plus man- aged care days or the days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation (i.e., for SFY 2010, prior SFY would be SFY 2009) adjusted downward by twenty-five percent (25%) of the differ- ence between the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days and the days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calcula- tion. 
(I) The FFS days plus managed care days are determined as follows: The FFS days are determined by applying a trend to the 

Page 1098 
Proposed Rules 
August 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 15 
second prior Calendar Year (CY) days (i.e., for SFY 2010, second prior CY would be 2008) as determined from the state’s Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS). The trend is determined from a regression analysis of the hospital’s FFS days from February 1999 through December of the second prior CY. The managed care days are based on the FFS days determined from the regression analysis, as follows: The FFS days are factored up by the percentage of FFS days to the total of FFS days plus managed care days from the hospital’s fourth prior year cost report. The difference between the FFS days and the FFS days factored up by the FFS days’ percentage are the managed care days. 
(II) The days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid pay- ment calculation adjusted downward by twenty-five percent (25%) are determined as follows: The days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation are compared to the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days as determined in part (15)(B)2.A.(I). If the hospital has greater estimated days as used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation than the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days as determined in part (15)(B)2.A.(I), the dif- ference between the days is multiplied by twenty-five percent (25%), and this amount is removed from the estimated days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation to arrive at the current year’s estimated days. 
B. Effective July 1, 2010, the estimated MO HealthNet patient days shall be the better of the sum of the FFS days plus man- aged care days or the days used in the SFY 2009 Direct Medicaid payment calculation adjusted downward by fifty percent (50%) of the difference between the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days and the days used in the SFY 2009 Direct Medicaid payment calcu- lation. 
(I) The FFS days plus managed care days are determined as set forth in part (15)(B)2.A.(I). 
(II) The days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid pay- ment calculation adjusted downward by fifty percent (50%) are deter- mined as follows: The days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation are compared to the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days as determined in part (15)(B)2.A.(I). If the hos- pital has greater estimated days as used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation than the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days as determined in part (15)(B)2.A.(I), the differ- ence between the days is multiplied by fifty percent (50%) and this amount is removed from the estimated days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation to arrive at the current year’s estimated days. 
C. Effective July 1, 2011, the estimated MO HealthNet patient days shall be the better of the sum of the FFS days plus man- aged care days or the days used in the SFY 2009 Direct Medicaid payment calculation adjusted downward by seventy-five percent (75%) of the difference between the sum of the FFS days plus man- aged care days and the days used in the SFY 2009 Direct Medicaid payment calculation. 
(I) The FFS days plus managed care days are determined as set forth in part (15)(B)2.A.(I). 
(II) The days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid pay- ment calculation adjusted downward by seventy-five percent (75%) are determined as follows: The days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation are compared to the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days as determined in part (15)(B)2.A.(I). If the hospital has greater estimated days as used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation than the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days as determined in part (15)(B)2.A.(I), the dif- ference between the days is multiplied by seventy-five percent (75%) and this amount is removed from the estimated days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation to arrive at the current year’s estimated days. 
D. Effective July 1, 2012, the estimated MO HealthNet patient days shall be the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days. The FFS days plus managed care days are determined as set forth in 
part (15)(B)2.A.(I). 
E. Effective for payments made on or after May 1, 2017, the estimated MO HealthNet patient days for the SFY shall be determined by adjusting the FFS days from the state’s MMIS for the second prior Calendar Year (CY) (i.e., for SFY 2017, second prior CY would be 2015) by: 
(I) The trend determined from a regression analysis of the hospital’s FFS days from February 1999 through December of the second prior CY; and 
(II) The days estimated to shift from FFS to managed care effective May 1, 2017. The estimated managed care days for populations added to managed care beginning May 1, 2017 will be subtracted from the trended FFS days to yield the estimated MO HealthNet patient days. 
[E.]F. The trended cost per day is calculated by trending the base year costs per day by the trend indices listed in paragraph (3)(B)1., using the rate calculation in subsection (3)(A). In addition to the trend indices applied to inflate base period costs to the current fiscal year, base year costs will be further adjusted by a Missouri Specific Trend. The Missouri Specific Trend will be used to address the fact that costs for Missouri inpatient care of MO HealthNet res- idents have historically exceeded the compounded inflation rates esti- mated using national hospital indices for a significant number of hos- pitals. The Missouri Specific Trend will be applied at one and one- half percent (1.5%) per year to the hospital’s base year. For example, hospitals with a 1998 base year will receive an additional six percent (6%) trend, and hospitals with a 1999 base year will receive an addi- tional four and one-half percent (4.5%) trend. 
(I) Effective for dates of service beginning July 1, 2010, the Missouri Specific Trend shall no longer be applied to inflate base period costs. 
[F.]G. For hospitals that meet the requirements in paragraphs (6)(A)1., (6)(A)2., and (6)(A)4. of this rule (safety net hospitals), the base year cost report may be from the third prior year, the fourth prior year, or the fifth prior year. For hospitals that meet the require- ments in paragraphs (6)(A)1. and (6)(A)3. of this rule (first tier Disproportionate Share Hospitals), the base year operating costs may be the third or fourth prior year cost report. The MO HealthNet Division shall exercise its sole discretion as to which report is most representative of costs. For all other hospitals, the base year operat- ing costs are based on the fourth prior year cost report. For any hos- pital that has both a twelve- (12-) month cost report and a partial year cost report, its base period cost report for that year will be the twelve- (12-) month cost report. 
[G.]H. The trended cost per day does not include the costs associated with the FRA assessment, the application of minimum uti- lization, the utilization adjustment, and the poison control costs com- puted in paragraphs (15)(B)1., 3., 4., and 5.; 
3. The minimum utilization costs for capital and medical edu- cation is calculated by determining the difference in the hospital’s cost per day when applying the minimum utilization, as identified in paragraph (5)(C)4., and without applying the minimum utilization. The difference in the cost per day is multiplied by the estimated MO HealthNet patient days for the SFY; 
4. The utilization adjustment cost is determined by estimating the number of MO HealthNet inpatient days the hospital will not pro- vide as a result of the managed care health plans limiting inpatient hospital services. These days are multiplied by the hospital’s cost per day to determine the total cost associated with these days. This cost is divided by the remaining total patient days from its base period cost report to arrive at the increased cost per day. This increased cost per day is multiplied by the estimated MO HealthNet days for the current SFY to arrive at the MO HealthNet utilization adjustment. 
A. Effective January 1, 2010, hospitals other than safety net hospitals as defined in subsection (6)(B) will receive sixty-seven per- cent (67%) of the utilization adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph (15)(B)4. Safety net hospitals will continue to receive one hundred percent (100%) of the adjustment calculated in accordance 
 
August 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 15

with paragraph (15)(B)4. B. Effective July 1, 2010, hospitals other than safety net hos- 
pitals as defined in subsection (6)(B), children’s hospitals as defined in subsection (2)(S), and specialty pediatric hospitals as defined in subsection (2)(P) will receive thirty-four percent (34%) of the utiliza- tion adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph (15)(B)4. Children’s hospitals and specialty pediatric hospitals will receive fifty percent (50%) of the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph (15)(B)4. Safety net hospitals will continue to receive one hundred percent (100%) of the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph (15)(B)4. 
C. Effective July 1, 2011, the utilization adjustment will no longer apply to any hospital other than safety net hospitals as defined in subsection (6)(B), children’s hospitals as defined in subsection (2)(S), and specialty pediatric hospitals as defined in subsection (2)(P). Children’s hospitals and specialty pediatric hospitals will continue to receive fifty percent (50%) of the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph (15)(B)4. Safety net hospitals will con- tinue to receive one hundred percent (100%) of the adjustment cal- culated in accordance with paragraph (15)(B)4.; 
5. The poison control cost shall reimburse the hospital for the prorated MO HealthNet managed care cost. It will be calculated by multiplying the estimated MO HealthNet share of the poison control costs by the percentage of managed care participants to total MO HealthNet participants; and

Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 70—MO HealthNet Division Chapter 15—Hospital Program 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 13 CSR 70-15.110 Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA). The 
division is amending subsection (1)(A) and adding section (21). 
PURPOSE: This amendment provides for the State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2018 trend factor to be applied to the inpatient and outpatient adjust- ed net revenues determined from the Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA) fiscal year cost report to determine the inpatient and outpatient adjusted net revenues subject to the FRA assessment. Additionally, this amendment establishes the FRA assessment effec- tive July 1, 2017 at a rate of five and seventy hundredths percent (5.70%) of each hospital’s inpatient and outpatient adjusted net rev- enues along with further changes to the FRA assessment if the dis- proportionate share hospital allotment reductions are implemented during SFY 2018. 
(1) Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA). FRA shall be assessed as described in this section. 
(A) Definitions. 1. Bad debts—Amounts considered to be uncollectible from 
accounts and notes receivable that were created or acquired in pro- viding services. Allowable bad debts include the costs of caring for patients who have insurance, but their insurance does not cover the particular service procedures or treatment rendered. 
2. Base cost report—Desk-reviewed Medicare/Medicaid cost report. The Medicare/Medicaid Cost Report version 2552-96 (CMS 2552-96) shall be used for fiscal years ending on or after September 30, 1996. The Medicare/Medicaid Cost Report version 2552-10 (CMS 2552-10) shall be used for fiscal years beginning on and after May 1, 2010. When a hospital has more than one (1) cost report with periods ending in the base year, the cost report covering a full twelve- (12-) month period will be used. If none of the cost reports covers a full twelve (12) months, the cost report with the latest period will be used. If a hospital’s base cost report is less than or greater than a twelve- (12-) month period, the data shall be adjusted, based on the number of months reflected in the base cost report, to a twelve- (12-) month period. 
3. Charity care—Those charges written off by a hospital based on the hospital’s policy to provide health care services free of charge or at a reduced charge because of the indigence or medical indigence of the patient. 
4. Contractual allowances—Difference between established rates for covered services and the amount paid by third-party payers under contractual agreements. The Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA) is a cost to the hospital, regardless of how the FRA is remitted to the MO HealthNet Division, and shall not be included in contractual allowances for determining revenues. Any redistribu- tions of MO HealthNet payments by private entities acting at the request of participating health care providers shall not be included in contractual allowances or determining revenues or cost of patient care. 
5. Department—Department of Social Services. 6. Director—Director of the Department of Social Services. 7. Division—MO HealthNet Division, Department of Social 
Services. 8. Engaging in the business of providing inpatient health care— 
Accepting payment for inpatient services rendered. 9. Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA)—The fee assessed 
to hospitals for the privilege of engaging in the business of providing inpatient health care in Missouri. The FRA is an allowable cost to the hospital. 
10. Fiscal period—Twelve- (12-) month reporting period deter- mined by each hospital. 
11. Gross hospital service charges—Total charges made by the hospital for inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are covered under 13 CSR 70-15.010. 
12. Hospital—A place devoted primarily to the maintenance and operation of facilities for the diagnosis, treatment, or care for not fewer than twenty-four (24) hours in any week of three (3) or more nonrelated individuals suffering from illness, disease, injury, defor- mity, or other abnormal physical conditions; or a place devoted pri- marily to provide, for not fewer than twenty-four (24) hours in any week, medical or nursing care for three (3) or more nonrelated indi- viduals. The term hospital does not include convalescent, nursing, shelter, or boarding homes as defined in Chapter 198, RSMo. 
13. Hospital revenues subject to FRA assessment effective July 1, 2008—Each hospital’s inpatient adjusted net revenues and outpa- tient adjusted net revenues subject to the FRA assessment will be determined as follows: 
A. Obtain “Gross Total Charges” from Worksheet G-2, Line 25, Column 3 from CMS 2552-96, or Worksheet G-2, Line 28, Column 3 from CMS 2552-10, of the third prior year cost report (i.e., FRA fiscal year cost report) for the hospital. Charges shall exclude revenues for physician services. Charges related to activities subject to the Missouri taxes assessed for outpatient retail pharma- cies and nursing facility services shall also be excluded. “Gross Total Charges” will be reduced by the following: 
(I) “Nursing Facility Charges” from Worksheet C, Part I, Line 35, Column 6 from CMS 2552-96, or Worksheet C, Part I, Line 45, Column 6 from CMS 2552-10; 
(II) “Swing Bed Nursing Facility Charges” from Worksheet G-2, Line 5, Column 1 from CMS 2552-96, or Worksheet G-2, Line 6, Column 1 from CMS 2552-10; 
(III) “Nursing Facility Ancillary Charges” as determined from the Department of Social Services, MO HealthNet Division, nursing home cost report. (Note: To the extent that the gross hospital charges, as specified in subparagraph (1)(A)13.A. above, include long-term care charges, the charges to be excluded through this step shall include all long-term care ancillary charges including skilled nursing facility, nursing facility, and other long-term care providers based at the hospital that are subject to the state’s provider tax on nursing facility services.);

B. Obtain “Net Revenue” from Worksheet G-3, Line 3, Column 1. The state will ensure this amount is net of bad debts and other uncollectible charges by survey methodology; 
C. “Adjusted Gross Total Charges” (the result of the compu- tations in subparagraph (1)(A)13.A.) will then be further adjusted by a hospital-specific collection-to-charge ratio determined as follows: 
(I) Divide “Net Revenue” by “Gross Total Charges”; and 
(II) “Adjusted Gross Total Charges” will be multiplied by the result of part (1)(A)13.C.(I) to yield “Adjusted Net Revenue”;

(II) “Adjusted Net Revenue” will then be multiplied by the result to yield “Net Inpatient Revenue”; and 
(III) The remainder will be allocated to “Net Outpatient Revenue”; and 
G. The trend indices listed below will be applied to the apportioned inpatient adjusted net revenue and outpatient adjusted net revenue in order to inflate or trend forward the adjusted net rev- enues from the FRA fiscal year cost report to the current state fiscal year to determine the inpatient and outpatient adjusted net revenues subject to the FRA assessment. 
(I) SFY 2009 = 5.50% (II) SFY 2009 Missouri Specific Trend = 1.50% (III) SFY 2010 = 3.90% (IV) SFY 2010 Missouri Specific Trend = 1.50% (V) SFY 2011 = 3.20% (VI) SFY 2012 = 5.33% (VII) SFY 2013 = 4.4% (VIII) SFY 2014 =

The FRA assessment rate of five and seventy hundredths percent (5.70%) will be applied individually to the hospital’s inpatient adjusted net revenues and outpatient adjusted net revenues. The hospital’s total FRA assessment is the sum of the assessment determined from its inpatient adjusted net revenue plus the assessment determined for its outpatient adjusted net revenue. 
(A) If the reduction of disproportionate share hospital allot- ments for federal fiscal year 2018 is implemented as provided in section 1923(f)(7) of the Social Security Act, the FRA assessment shall be set, effective on the date of such reduction, at the rate of five and fifty hundredths percent (5.50%) of each hospital’s inpa- tient adjusted net revenues and outpatient adjusted net revenues as set forth in paragraph (1)(A)13.

tient adjusted net revenues. The hospital’s total FRA assessment is the sum of the assessment determined from its inpatient adjusted net revenue plus the assessment determined for its out- patient adjusted net revenue.

August 1, 2017 In Additions MISSOURI Vol. 42, No. 15 REGISTER 

This section may contain notice of hearings, correction notices, public information notices, rule action notices, statements of actual costs, and other items required to be pub- lished in the Missouri Register by law. 

Title 3—DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION Division 10—Conservation Commission Chapter 4—Wildlife Code: General Provisions 
STATEMENT OF ACTUAL COST 
3 CSR 10-4.200 Chronic Wasting Disease; Management Zone 
The original estimated public cost for this rulemaking was published in the Missouri Register on January 15, 2016 (41 MoReg 74–76). Even though the actual cost to state agencies and political subdivi- sions did not exceed the cost estimate by more than ten percent (10%), the estimated costs deviated from the actual costs sufficiently to warrant explanation for purposes of section 536.200.2, RSMo. As described below, the estimated cost was four hundred ninety-four thousand, one hundred thirty-seven dollars ($494,137); at the end of the first full fiscal year, the actual cost to state agencies and political subdivisions was two hundred ninety-one thousand, seven hundred forty-six dollars ($291,746). 
The original estimated cost to public entities included salaries for full- time staff at a cost of one hundred eighty-seven thousand, two hundred eighteen dollars ($187,218). After further review, it is the depart- ment’s conclusion that labor costs for existing full-time staff should not have been included as an added expense. However, the number of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) samples taken during mandatory sampling efforts was underestimated by nine percent (9%), as there were one thousand seven hundred five (1,705) more samples submitted for testing than originally estimated. This resulted in thirty-three thou- sand, five hundred forty dollars ($33,540) more than originally esti- mated for testing of CWD samples. Furthermore, the department did not estimate added expense for field supplies and for staff travel expenses that resulted in a cost of fifty-four thousand, six hundred sev- enty-three dollars ($54,673) and one hundred forty-six thousand, one hundred seventy dollars ($146,170), respectively. 
The overall cost for mandatory sampling was five hundred sixty-four thousand, four hundred fifty-three dollars ($564,453), which was sev- enty thousand, three hundred sixteen dollars ($70,316) or thirteen per- cent (13%) over the estimated fiscal cost. However, the cost for CWD testing and salaries for hourly technicians is seventy-five percent (75%) federally reimbursable, which was not factored into the original estimate. Making those adjustments, the actual cost for mandatory sampling in FY2017 was two hundred ninety-one thousand, seven hun- dred forty-six dollars ($291,746), or two hundred two thousand, three hundred ninety-one dollars ($202,391) less than the original estimated cost. The estimated annual costs are expected to be consistent with the actual costs for FY2016; however, the receipt of federal reimburse- ment in the long-term future is uncertain.
