MISSOURI Emergency Rules October 2, 2017 REGISTER Vol. 42, No. 19 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or (thirty) 30 legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 70—MO HealthNet Division Chapter 10—Nursing Home Program 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 
13 CSR 70-10.030 Prospective Reimbursement Plan for Nonstate- Operated Facilities for ICF/IID Services. The division is adding subparagraph (4)(A)1.Q. 
PURPOSE: This amendment provides for a per diem decrease to non- state-operated intermediate care facility for individuals with intellec- tual disabilities (ICF/IID) per diems of two and eighty-two hun- dredths percent (2.82%) effective for dates of service beginning September 1, 2017. This per diem decrease corresponds to the appro- priation granted in the State Fiscal Year 2018 budget, approved by the governor, and is contingent upon approval by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The Department of Social Services, MO HealthNet Division, by rule and regulation, must define the rea- sonable costs, manner, extent, quantity, quality, charges, and fees of medical assistance. Effective for State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2018, the appropriation reduced the funds available for nonstate-operated ICF/IID reimbursements. The MO HealthNet Division is carrying out the reduction by providing for a per diem decrease for nonstate-oper- ated ICF/IID reimbursement rates by decreasing the per diem by two and eighty-two hundredths percent (2.82%) effective for dates of ser- 
vice beginning September 1, 2017. The rate decrease is necessary to ensure that payments for nonstate-operated ICF/IID per diem rates are in-line with the funds appropriated for that purpose. There is a total of seven (7) nonstate-operated ICF/IIDs currently enrolled in MO HealthNet which will be subject to a per diem decrease in its reimbursement rate effective for dates of service beginning September 1, 2017. This emergency amendment will ensure payment for non- state-operated ICF/IID services to approximately seventy-seven (77) ICF/IID Missourians in accordance with the appropriation authority. For the SFY 2018 payment to be made, a Medicaid State Plan Amendment is required to be submitted and approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). This emergency amend- ment must be implemented on a timely basis to ensure that quality nonstate-operated ICF/IID services continue to be provided to MO HealthNet participants in nonstate-operated ICF/IID facilities during SFY 2018 in accordance with the appropriation authority. As a result, the MO HealthNet Division finds an immediate danger to public health, safety, and/or welfare and a compelling governmental inter- est, which requires emergency action. The MO HealthNet Division has a compelling governmental interest in providing continued cash flow for ICF/IID services. The scope of this emergency amendment is limited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended by the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The MO HealthNet Division believes this emergency amendment is fair to all interested persons and parties under the cir- cumstances. This emergency amendment was filed August 22, 2017, becomes effective September 1, 2017, and expires February 27, 2018. 
(4) Prospective Reimbursement Rate Computation. (A) Except in accordance with other provisions of this rule, the 
provisions of this section shall apply to all providers of ICF/IID ser- vices certified to participate in Missouri’s MO HealthNet program. 
1. ICF/IID facilities. A. Except in accordance with other provisions of this rule, 
the MO HealthNet program shall reimburse providers of these LTC services based on the individual MO HealthNet-participant days of care multiplied by the Title XIX prospective per diem rate less any payments collected from participants. The Title XIX prospective per diem reimbursement rate for the remainder of state Fiscal Year 1987 shall be the facility’s per diem reimbursement payment rate in effect on October 31, 1986, as adjusted by updating the facility’s allowable base year to its 1985 fiscal year. Each facility’s per diem costs as reported on its Fiscal Year 1985 Title XIX cost report will be deter- mined in accordance with the principles set forth in this rule. If a facility has not filed a 1985 fiscal year cost report, the most current cost report on file with the department will be used to set its per diem rate. Facilities with less than a full twelve- (12-) month 1985 fiscal year will not have their base year rates updated. 
B. For state FY-88 and dates of service beginning July 1, 1987, the negotiated trend factor shall be equal to two percent (2%) to be applied in the following manner: Two percent (2%) of the aver- age per diem rate paid to both state- and nonstate-operated ICF/IID facilities on June 1, 1987, shall be added to each facility’s rate. 
C. For state FY-89 and dates of service beginning January 1, 1989, the negotiated trend factor shall be equal to one percent (1%) to be applied in the following manner: One percent (1%) of the aver- age per diem rate paid to both state- and nonstate-operated ICF/IID facilities on June 1, 1988, shall be added to each facility’s rate. 
D.

This increase shall only be used for increases for the salaries and fringe benefits for direct care staff and their immediate supervisors. 
H. State FY-2001 trend factor. All nonstate-operated ICF/IID facilities shall be granted an increase to their per diem rates effective for dates of service beginning July 1, 2000, of four dollars and eighty-one cents ($4.81) per patient day for the trend factor.

This adjustment is equal to thirteen and ninety-five hundredths percent (13.95%) of the per diem rate paid to nonstate-operated ICF/IID facilities on June 30, 2008. This increase is intended to provide compensation to providers for the years (2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006) where no trend factor was given.

2. Adjustments to rates. The prospectively determined reim- bursement rate may be adjusted only under the following conditions: A. When information contained in a facility’s cost report is found to be fraudulent, misrepresented, or inaccurate, the facility’s reimbursement rate may be reduced, both retroactively and prospec- tively, if the fraudulent, misrepresented, or inaccurate information as originally reported resulted in establishment of a higher reimburse- ment rate than the facility would have received in the absence of this information. No decision by the MO HealthNet agency to impose a rate adjustment in the case of fraudulent, misrepresented, or inaccu- rate information in any way shall affect the MO HealthNet agency’s ability to impose any sanctions authorized by statute or rule. The fact that fraudulent, misrepresented, or inaccurate information reported did not result in establishment of a higher reimbursement rate than the facility would have received in the absence of the information also does not affect the MO HealthNet agency’s ability to impose any 
sanctions authorized by statute or rules; B. In accordance with subsection (6)(B) of this rule, a newly 
constructed facility’s initial reimbursement rate may be reduced if the facility’s actual allowable per diem cost for its first twelve (12) months of operation is less than its initial rate; 
C. When a facility’s MO HealthNet reimbursement rate is higher than either its private pay rate or its Medicare rate, the MO HealthNet rate will be reduced in accordance with subsection (2)(B) of this rule; 
D. When the provider can show that it incurred higher cost due to circumstances beyond its control, and the circumstances are not experienced by the nursing home or ICF/IID industry in general, the request must have a substantial cost effect. These circumstances include, but are not limited to: 
(I) Acts of nature, such as fire, earthquakes, and flood, that are not covered by insurance; 
(II) Vandalism, civil disorder, or both; or 
(III) Replacement of capital depreciable items not built into existing rates that are the result of circumstances not related to nor- mal wear and tear or upgrading of existing system; 
E. When an adjustment to a facility’s rate is made in accor- dance with the provisions of section (6) of this rule; or 
F. When an adjustment is based on an Administrative Hearing Commission or court decision.

Emergency Rules 

Title 22—MISSOURI CONSOLIDATED HEALTH CARE PLAN Division 10—Health Care Plan Chapter 2—State Membership 
EMERGENCY RESCISSION 
22 CSR 10-2.094 Tobacco-Free Incentive Provisions and Limitations. The rule established the policy of the board of trustees in regards to the Strive for Wellness® Tobacco-Free Incentive and the method and timeframes in which the requirements of the incentive must be completed and submitted. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded and readopted to include detailed language to clarify Tobacco-Free Incentive Provisions and Limitations. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: This emergency rescission must be in place by October 1, 2017, in accordance with the new plan year. Therefore, this emergency rescission is necessary to serve a com- pelling governmental interest of protecting members (employees, retirees, officers, and their families) enrolled in the Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan (MCHCP) from the unintended con- sequences of confusion regarding eligibility or availability of benefits and will allow members to take advantage of opportunities for reduced premiums for more affordable options without which they may forgo coverage. Further, it clarifies member eligibility and responsibility for various types of eligible charges, beginning with the first day of coverage for the new plan year. It may also help ensure that inappropriate claims are not made against the state and help protect the MCHCP and its members from being subjected to unex- pected and significant financial liability and/or litigation. It is imper- ative that this rescission be filed as an emergency rescission to main- tain the integrity of the current health care plan. This emergency rescission must become effective October 1, 2017, to fulfill the com- pelling governmental interest of offering continuous health insurance to officers, state and public entity employees, retirees, and their fam- ilies. This rescission reflects changes made to the plan by the Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan Board of Trustees. A pro- posed rescission, which covers this same material, is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. This emergency rescission com- plies with the protections extended by the Missouri and United States Constitutions and limits its scope to the circumstances creating the emergency. The MCHCP follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circum- stances. This emergency rescission was filed August 31, 2017, becomes effective October 1, 2017, and expires March 29, 2018. 
AUTHORITY: section 103.059, RSMo 2016. Emergency rule filed Nov. 1, 2011, effective Nov. 25, 2011, expired May 22, 2012. Original rule filed Nov. 1, 2011, effective April 30, 2012. For intervening his- tory, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Emergency rescission filed Aug. 31, 2017, effective Oct. 1, 2017, expires March 29, 2018. A proposed rescission covering this same material is pub- lished in this issue of the Missouri Register.

Limitations. This rule established the policy of the board of trustees in regards to the Strive for Wellness® Partnership Incentive and the method and timeframes in which the requirements of the incentive must be completed and submitted. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded and readopted to include detailed language to clarify Strive for Wellness® Partnership Incentive Provisions and Limitations. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: This emergency rescission must be in place by October 1, 2017, in accordance with the new plan year. Therefore, this emergency rescission is necessary to serve a com- pelling governmental interest of protecting members (employees, retirees, officers, and their families) enrolled in the Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan (MCHCP) from the unintended con- sequences of confusion regarding eligibility or availability of benefits and will allow members to take advantage of opportunities for reduced premiums for more affordable options without which they may forgo coverage. Further, it clarifies member eligibility and responsibility for various types of eligible charges, beginning with the first day of coverage for the new plan year. It may also help ensure that inappropriate claims are not made against the state and help protect the MCHCP and its members from being subjected to unex- pected and significant financial liability and/or litigation. It is imper- ative that this rescission be filed as an emergency rescission to main- tain the integrity of the current health care plan. This emergency rescission must become effective October 1, 2017, to fulfill the com- pelling governmental interest of offering continuous health insurance to officers, state and public entity employees, retirees, and their fam- ilies. This rescission reflects changes made to the plan by the Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan Board of Trustees. A pro- posed rescission, which covers this same material, is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. This emergency rescission com- plies with the protections extended by the Missouri and United States Constitutions and limits its scope to the circumstances creating the emergency. The MCHCP follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circum- stances. This emergency rescission was filed August 31, 2017, becomes effective Oct. 1, 2017, and expires March 29, 2018.

Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

Title 3—DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION Division 10—Conservation Commission Chapter 8—Wildlife Code: Trapping: Seasons, Methods 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 3 CSR 10-8.510 Use of Traps. The commission proposes to amend 
subsection (4)(B) of this rule. 
PURPOSE: This amendment removes the certification requirement for cable restraint users because travel to the available certification courses is burdensome upon constituents and the holding of such classes has been determined to be an unnecessary expenditure of state resources. The original concern that prompted the certification requirement was that illegal sets of cable restraint devices would harm free-roaming dogs. Since 2005, there have been minimal instances in which free-roaming dogs have been harmed by cable restraint devices and illegal sets have not been an issue. Other edu- cational mechanisms are available to educate trappers without the burden of a certification course. 
(4) Use of Snares and Cable Restraint Devices. (B) Furbearers may be taken by trapping through the use of cable 
restraint devices during specified seasons (3 CSR 10-8.515) [by per- sons who have successfully completed the cable restraint training course taught by a certified instructor]. Cable restraint devices (as defined in 3 CSR 10-20.805) must have a loop size of twelve inches (12") in diameter or smaller when set, and the bottom of set restraint cable loop must be at least six inches (6") or greater above the ground. Cable restraint devices must be anchored solid or staked in a location not allowing entanglement (such as rooted, woody vegetation greater than one-half inch (1/2") in diameter), and shall not be capable of extending to within twelve inches (12") of a fence, nor shall be set using a drag, or used with a kill-pole. Cable restraint devices may not be used within one hundred fifty feet (150') of any residence, occupied building, or a driveway leading to a resi- dence. 
AUTHORITY: sections 40 and 45 of Art. IV, Mo. Const. and section 252.040, RSMo [2000] 2016. Original rule filed Sept. 20, 1957, effective Dec. 31, 1957. For intervening history, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Amended: Filed Aug. 29, 2017. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed amendment will not cost state agen- cies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed amendment will not cost private enti- ties more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed amendment with Regulations Committee Chairman, Department of Conservation, PO Box 180, Jefferson City, MO 65102-0180, or via the department’s website at http://short.mdc.mo.gov/Z49.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
13 CSR 70-10.030 Prospective Reimbursement Plan for Nonstate- Operated Facilities for ICF/IID Services. The division is adding subparagraph (4)(A)1.Q. 
PURPOSE: This proposed amendment provides for a per diem decrease to nonstate-operated intermediate care facility for individu- als with intellectual disabilities (ICF/IID) per diems of two and eighty-two hundredths percent (2.82%) effective for dates of service beginning September 1, 2017. This per diem decrease corresponds to the appropriation granted in the State Fiscal Year 2018 budget, approved by the governor, and is contingent upon approval by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 
(4) Prospective Reimbursement Rate Computation. (A) Except in accordance with other provisions of this rule, the 
provisions of this section shall apply to all providers of ICF/IID ser- vices certified to participate in Missouri’s MO HealthNet program. 
1. ICF/IID facilities. A. Except in accordance with other provisions of this rule, 
the MO HealthNet program shall reimburse providers of these LTC services based on the individual MO HealthNet-participant days of care multiplied by the Title XIX prospective per diem rate less any payments collected from participants. The Title XIX prospective per diem reimbursement rate for the remainder of state Fiscal Year 1987 shall be the facility’s per diem reimbursement payment rate in effect on October 31, 1986, as adjusted by updating the facility’s allowable base year to its 1985 fiscal year. Each facility’s per diem costs as reported on its Fiscal Year 1985 Title XIX cost report will be deter- mined in accordance with the principles set forth in this rule. If a facility has not filed a 1985 fiscal year cost report, the most current cost report on file with the department will be used to set its per diem rate. Facilities with less than a full twelve- (12-) month 1985 fiscal year will not have their base year rates updated. 
B. For state FY-88 and dates of service beginning July 1, 1987, the negotiated trend factor shall be equal to two percent (2%) to be applied in the following manner: Two percent (2%) of the aver- age per diem rate paid to both state- and nonstate-operated ICF/IID facilities on June 1, 1987, shall be added to each facility’s rate. 
C.

E. FY-96 negotiated trend factor. All nonstate-operated ICF/IID facilities shall be granted an increase to their per diem rates effective for dates of service beginning January 1, 1996, of six dol- lars and seven cents ($6.07) per patient day for the negotiated trend factor. This adjustment is equal to four and six-tenths percent (4.6%) of the weighted average per diem rates paid to nonstate-operated ICF/IID facilities on June 1, 1995, of one hundred and thirty-one dollars and ninety-three cents ($131.93). 
F. State FY-99 trend factor. All nonstate-operated ICF/IID facilities shall be granted an increase to their per diem rates effective for dates of service beginning July 1, 1998, of four dollars and forty- seven cents ($4.47) per patient day for the trend factor.

All nonstate-operated ICF/IID facilities shall be granted an increase to their per diem rates effective for dates of service beginning July 1, 2000, of four dollars and eighty-one cents ($4.81) per patient day for the trend factor. This adjustment is equal to three percent (3%) of the weighted average per diem rate paid to nonstate-operated ICF/IID facilities on April 30, 2000, of one hundred sixty dollars and twenty-three cents ($160.23). This increase shall only be used for increases for salaries and fringe 
benefits for direct care staff and their immediate supervisors. I. State FY-2007 trend factor. All nonstate-operated ICF/IID facilities shall be granted an increase of seven percent (7%) to their per diem rates effective for dates of service billed for state fiscal year 2007 and thereafter.

This adjustment is equal to thirteen and ninety-five hundredths percent (13.95%) of the per diem rate paid to nonstate-operated ICF/IID facilities on June 30, 2008. This increase is intended to provide compensation to providers for the years [(2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006)] where no trend factor was given. The catch up increase was based on the CMS PPS Skilled Nursing Facility Input Price Index (four- (4)- quarter moving average). 
M. State FY-2012 trend factor.

2. Adjustments to rates. The prospectively determined reim- bursement rate may be adjusted only under the following conditions: A. When information contained in a facility’s cost report is found to be fraudulent, misrepresented, or inaccurate, the facility’s reimbursement rate may be reduced, both retroactively and prospec- tively, if the fraudulent, misrepresented, or inaccurate information as originally reported resulted in establishment of a higher reimburse- ment rate than the facility would have received in the absence of this information. No decision by the MO HealthNet agency to impose a rate adjustment in the case of fraudulent, misrepresented, or inaccu- rate information in any way shall affect the MO HealthNet agency’s ability to impose any sanctions authorized by statute or rule. The fact that fraudulent, misrepresented, or inaccurate information reported did not result in establishment of a higher reimbursement rate than the facility would have received in the absence of the information also does not affect the MO HealthNet agency’s ability to impose any 
sanctions authorized by statute or rules; B. In accordance with subsection (6)(B) of this rule, a newly 
constructed facility’s initial reimbursement rate may be reduced if the facility’s actual allowable per diem cost for its first twelve (12) months of operation is less than its initial rate; 
C. When a facility’s MO HealthNet reimbursement rate is higher than either its private pay rate or its Medicare rate, the MO HealthNet rate will be reduced in accordance with subsection (2)(B) of this rule; 
D. When the provider can show that it incurred higher cost due to circumstances beyond its control, and the circumstances are not experienced by the nursing home or ICF/IID industry in general, the request must have a substantial cost effect. These circumstances include, but are not limited to: 
(I) Acts of nature, such as fire, earthquakes, and flood, that are not covered by insurance; 
(II) Vandalism, civil disorder, or both; or 
(III) Replacement of capital depreciable items not built into existing rates that are the result of circumstances not related to nor- mal wear and tear or upgrading of existing system; 
E. When an adjustment to a facility’s rate is made in accor- dance with the provisions of section (6) of this rule; or 
F. When an adjustment is based on an Administrative Hearing Commission or court decision.

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) received one (1) letter with one (1) comment. 
COMMENT: Matthew Keppler, March of Dimes, requests DHSS to consider amending the rule such that if a new technology were to be identified in the future, critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening would continue seamlessly with the new technology with- out necessitating changes in the regulation. 
RESPONSE: Section 191.334.3, RSMo directs the CCHD screening 
to be conducted by pulse oximetry or in another manner as directed by DHSS in accordance with the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Association guidelines. A DHSS directive must be designated in administrative rule in order to make the directive manda- tory for all who are required to follow the directive. Statutes regarding administrative rules do not allow DHSS to designate a technology that does not exist at the time the rule becomes effective because the administrative rules process lends itself to providing notification and a public comment period prior to a new mandate. If new technology for CCHD screening becomes the standard recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Association, DHSS will take the appropriate steps to amend the rule accordingly. No changes have been made to this rule as a result of this comment.
