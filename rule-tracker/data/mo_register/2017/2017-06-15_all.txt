MISSOURI Proposed Rules June 15, 2017 REGISTER Vol. 42, No. 12 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]

The ninety- (90-) day period during which an agency shall file its order of rulemaking for publication in the Missouri Register begins either: 1) after the hearing on the proposed rulemaking is held; or 2) at the end of the time for submission of comments to the agency. During this period, the agency shall file with the secretary of state the order of rulemaking, either putting the proposed rule into effect, with or without further changes, or withdrawing the proposed rule.

ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Public Service Commission under sec- tion 386.410, RSMo 2016, the commission adopts a rule as follows: 
4 CSR 240-4.015 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on January 3, 2017 (42 MoReg 17–18). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. The proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended February 2, 2017, and on February 16, 2017, the commission held a public hearing on the proposed rule. Timely written comments were received from the Office of the Public Counsel (OPC), the Missouri Energy Development Association (MEDA), the Missouri Cable Telecommunications Association (MCTA), Union Electric Company d/b/a Ameren Missouri (Ameren Missouri), Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers (MIEC), Midwest Energy Consumers Group (MECG), and Consumers Council of Missouri. In addition to those entities, the commission’s staff, Missouri American Water Company, Laclede Gas Company, Kansas City Power & Light Company, Empower Missouri, and AARP Missouri all offered com- ments at the hearing. The comments of regulated utilities and utility associations generally supported the proposed rule, with modifica- 
tions. The Office of the Public Counsel and other organizations rep- resenting consumers all strongly opposed adopting the proposed rule. 
COMMENT #1: Application of the proposed rule would be limited to contested cases, but OPC suggests adding the words “pending case” throughout the section to also include non-contested cases, which can be cases involving large sums of money of great public interest. Staff also expressed the opinion that the definition of an ex parte communication should be expanded to include all pending cases, rather than limited to contested cases, as it is sometimes hard to distinguish between contested and non-contested cases. MCTA is also concerned that the proposed rule limits ex parte and extra record communications to contested cases. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees that distinguishing between contested and non-contested cases is difficult and that the ex parte and extra-record communica- tion requirements should apply to all pending cases, with limited exceptions. However, rather than adding the words “pending case” throughout the rules, it would be more clear and efficient to remove the definition of “contested case” and replace it with a new definition of “case” to reach the same result throughout the revised rules. 
COMMENT #2: MCTA stated that the disclosure of communications regarding general regulatory policy under the existing rule should be continued and not excluded from the definitions of ex parte and extra record communications. OPC proposes to include a new section with a definition of “general regulatory policy” to prevent ambiguity, since the phrase is stated throughout the revised rules. 
RESPONSE: The commission has determined that adding a defini- tion of general regulatory policy would not be helpful, as any defin- ition would be too broad and the new definitions of “ex parte com- munication” and “extra-record communication” should remove any confusion as to application of the rules. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #3: Ameren Missouri comments that the words “or more” should be included in sections (5) and (6) to make clear that communications that occur any time after thirty (30) days has passed, once the commission has fully disposed of a case, are not ex parte communications and not just communications that take place on the 30th day. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees that for clarity the words “or more” should be added as suggested. 
COMMENT #4: Ameren Missouri comments that the proposed lan- guage in section (6) regarding the commission’s “non-party employ- ees” is confusing for persons unfamiliar with commission operations and could result in disputes in the future, considering that other rules define the commission staff to include all employees working for the commission other than commissioners. Ameren Missouri suggests replacing the phrase “the commission’s non-party employees” with “commission employees within the commission’s executive or administration divisions” to make more clear which employees are excluded from the rule. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees that this language could be confusing, but rather than adopting Ameren Missouri’s proposed alternative, the commission will use the phrase “commission employees who are not commission staff” and include in this rule a new section with a definition of “commission staff.” 
COMMENT #5: In the proposed rule 4 CSR 240-4.017(4), OPC and Ameren Missouri state that the language refers to section 386.210.4, RSMo, but does not quote it entirely, and suggest that additional lan- guage from the statute should be added to make it clear that discussion

Missouri Register 
Page 913 

of the merits of specific facts and evidence are not permitted commu- nications. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with these comments and will revise the definition of “substantive issue” in section (14) with the words “Merits of specific facts, evidence, claims, or positions...” to correct this error.

Title 4—DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Division 240—Public Service Commission Chapter 4—Standards of Conduct 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Public Service Commission under sec- tion 386.410, RSMo 2016, the commission adopts a rule as follows: 
4 CSR 240-4.017 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on January 3, 2017 (42 MoReg 18). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. The proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended February 2, 2017, and on February 16, 2017, the commission held a public hearing on the proposed rule. Timely written comments were received from the Office of the Public Counsel (OPC), the Missouri Energy Development Association (MEDA), the Missouri Cable Telecommunications Association (MCTA), Union Electric Company d/b/a Ameren Missouri (Ameren Missouri), Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers (MIEC), Midwest Energy Consumers Group (MECG), and Consumers Council of Missouri. In addition to those entities, the commission’s staff, Missouri American Water Company, Laclede Gas Company, Kansas City Power & Light Company, Empower Missouri, and AARP Missouri all offered comments at the hearing. The comments of regulated utilities and utility associations generally supported the proposed rule, with modifications. The Office of the Public Counsel and other organizations representing consumers all strongly opposed adopting the proposed rule. 
COMMENT #1: OPC comments that in section (1) the word “any” should be removed and substituted with the word “all” in order to encompass the entirety of communications and not just a select few. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees and will make the requested change. 
COMMENT #2: Staff cautioned that the proposed sixty- (60-) day notice provision of section (1) does not appear in the statute and so may not be authorized by law. Ameren Missouri is concerned about this requirement and states that the proposed rule, as written, effec- tively transforms all tariff filings into ninety- (90-) day tariffs, rather than in thirty (30) days as contemplated by section 393.140(11), RSMo. MEDA and Laclede recommend that section (1) be deleted because it is unfair and unlawful and instead require a filing party to submit a declaration stating that it has not discussed the matter with any commissioner during a reasonable period (thirty (30) or sixty (60) days) prior to the filing. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commission finds that section (1) does not unlawfully limit access to the commis- sion because of the ability of a party to request waivers, which are rou- tinely granted. The commission has made this provision apply to all cases, not just contested cases, as it has done throughout the six (6) proposed rules at the request of several commenters to avoid confusion regarding to what cases the provision applies. Finally, while nothing in the statute specifically authorizes a sixty- (60-) day notice, such a notice does not conflict with any principle or provision of the statute

Orders of Rulemaking 

and strikes an appropriate balance between transparency and the free exchange of information regarding general regulatory policy. 
COMMENT #3: OPC states that the commission should replace the word “may” in subsection (1)(A) with the mandatory language “shall.” RESPONSE: The commission disagrees with the comment and finds that the word “may” is appropriate to maintain commission discre- tion in responding to non-compliant filings. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #4: OPC comments that the proposed rule cannot limit complaints filed under section 386.390, so the words “section 386.390 RSMo or” in subsection (1)(C) should be added before cit- ing the rule 4 CSR 240-2.070. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees and will make the suggested change. 
COMMENT #5: OPC states that the filing requirement in subsection (1)(C) is an unnecessary burden on OPC when it brings an action to protect the public. The information the commission seeks to require is more appropriate in the complaint filing requirements of rule 4 CSR 240-2.070(4). 
RESPONSE: The commission disagrees that the filing requirement is an unnecessary burden on OPC and determines that all parties should be treated equally with regard to the filing requirements. If any party wishes to argue harm will result from complying with the notice requirement in any particular case, that party may do so in a waiver request, as provided for in the rule. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #6: Ameren Missouri proposes the following alterna- tive language in subsection (1)(D) about what a party should file to demonstrate good cause for a waiver of the sixty- (60-) day notice: Good cause for waiver may include... “that circumstances prevented filing the required notice and delaying the filing for sixty (60) days would cause harm, or stating facts demonstrating that making a tariff effect on less than sixty-day’s notice would not result in any harm, notwithstanding that a sixty-day notice has not been given.” OPC states that the entire sentence about filing a declaration to show good cause should be deleted because the declaration cannot be indepen- dently verified and would not protect against ex parte communica- tions about issues raised by intervening parties. 
RESPONSE: The commission disagrees with the comments that the language regarding good cause should be amended. It is not neces- sary to specify all circumstances that would qualify as good cause. The commission also disagrees that the good cause language should be deleted. The opportunity to request a waiver is important to pro- tect against potential harms of waiting sixty (60) days to file a case, and it is necessary to argue good cause in order to receive a waiver. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #7: OPC comments that in section (3) additional docu- mentation of each tour should be made in all open case files. OPC suggests adding the following sentence to the subsection: “After each tour a summary shall be disclosed in each open case file for the spon- soring utility. The summary shall be in accordance with the require- ments of 4 CSR 240-4.020(2).” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees that the section should be amended, but the suggested language would require filings in cases that are not related to the sub- ject matter disclosed. The commission will instead change the lan- guage of the rule to provide that if a commissioner chooses to par- ticipate in a tour, the tour shall be posted to that commissioner’s cal- endar at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance. 
COMMENT #8: OPC and Ameren Missouri state that section (4) of the rule refers to section 386.210.4, RSMo, but does not quote it 
entirely. OPC and Ameren Missouri suggest that additional language from the statute should be added to make it clear that discussion of the merits of specific facts and evidence are not permitted communi- cations. 
RESPONSE: These comments were accommodated by revising the definition of “substantive issue” in proposed rule 4 CSR 240- 4.015(14). No changes have been made to this rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #9: OPC proposes to add a new section substantially reflecting the wording in the current rule 4 CSR 240-4.020(9) to ensure that commissioners keep calendars available to the public dis- playing the notices and other disclosures required by other sections of the rules. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees that the section should be amended, but the suggested language is inconsistent with this proposed rule and proposed rule 4 CSR 240-4.015. The commission will instead change the language of the rule to provide that each commissioner shall maintain a public calendar on the commission’s website to which the commissioners’ regulatory activities may be posted. 
COMMENT #10: OPC proposes to add a new section substantially reflecting the wording in the current rule 4 CSR 240-4.020(11) to prevent future parties from attempting to unduly influence the com- mission and provide a method to publicly disclose the communica- tion once a case is filed. 
RESPONSE: The commission disagrees with the suggested language because it is unnecessary and inconsistent with the definitions in this proposed rule and proposed rule 4 CSR 240-4.015. However, the change made in response to comment #11 below addresses the por- tion of the comment that expresses concerns about influencing future cases. 
COMMENT #11: OPC proposes to add a new section substantially reflecting the wording in the current rule 4 CSR 240-4.020(12) as a policy statement that it is improper for interested persons and parties to attempt to sway the judgment of the commission outside of the hearing process. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees that such a section should be added, but will change the suggested language to better reflect the definitions applicable to this rule and to include a prohibition on eliciting representations from the commission regarding future rulings or positions in future delibera- tions. 
4 CSR 240-4.017 General Provisions 
(1) Any person that intends to file a case shall file a notice with the secretary of the commission a minimum of sixty (60) days prior to filing such case. Such notice shall detail the type of case and issues likely to be before the commission and shall include a summary of all communication regarding substantive issues likely to be in the case between the filing party and the office of the commission that occurred in the ninety (90) days prior to filing the notice. The filing of such notice shall initiate a new noticed case and be assigned an appropriate case designation and number. If the expected case filing is subsequently made, it shall be filed in the noticed case. If the expected case filing is not made within one hundred eighty (180) days, the noticed case shall close. 
(A) The commission may reject any filing not in compliance with this section. 
(B) This section shall not apply to small formal complaints under commission rule 4 CSR 240-2.070 or small utility rate cases under commission rule 4 CSR 240-3.050. 
(C) This section shall not apply to formal complaints under section 386.390, RSMo, or commission rule 4 CSR 240-2.070. However, formal complaints shall include, contemporaneous with the filing ini- tiating the complaint, a summary of any communication regarding

Missouri Register 
Page 915 

substantive issues likely to be in the case between the filing party and the office of the commission that occurred in the sixty (60) days prior to filing the complaint. 
(D) A party may request a waiver of this section for good cause. Good cause for waiver may include, among other things, a verified declaration from the filing party that it has had no communication with the office of the commission within the prior one hundred fifty (150) days regarding any substantive issue likely to be in the case or that circumstances prevented filing the required notice and delaying the filing for sixty (60) days would cause harm. 
(3) A utility regulated by the commission that offers a tour of its facilities to the office of the commission shall also offer the Office of the Public Counsel an opportunity to participate in that tour. If a commissioner chooses to participate in a tour, the tour shall be post- ed to that commissioner’s calendar at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance. 
(4) Each commissioner shall maintain a public calendar on the com- mission’s website to which the commissioners’ regulatory activities may be posted. 
(5) It is improper for any person interested in a case or noticed case to— 
(A) Attempt to influence the judgment of the commission by bringing pressure to bear upon the office of the commission outside of the case process, or 
(B) Seek to elicit representations from the office of the commis- sion before a case or noticed case is filed regarding the commission’s future rulings or any commissioner’s positions in future delibera- tions. 
(6) Pursuant to section 386.210.4, RSMo, nothing in this rule shall be construed as imposing any limitation on the free exchange of ideas, views, and information between any person and the commis- sion or any commissioner, provided that such communications relate to matters of general regulatory policy and do not address substantive issues in or likely to be in a case or noticed case. 
Title 4—DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Division 240—Public Service Commission Chapter 4—Standards of Conduct 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Public Service Commission under sec- tion 386.410, RSMo 2016, the commission rescinds a rule as fol- lows: 
4 CSR 240-4.020 Ex Parte and Extra-Record Communications is rescinded. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the proposed rescission was published in the Missouri Register on January 3, 2017 (42 MoReg 18–19). No changes have been made in the proposed rescis- sion, so it is not reprinted here. The proposed rescission becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended February 2, 2017, and on February 16, 2017, the commission held a public hearing on the proposed rescission. Timely written comments were received from the Office of the Public Counsel (OPC), the Missouri Energy Development Association (MEDA), the Missouri Cable Telecommunications Association, Union Electric Company d/b/a Ameren Missouri (Ameren Missouri), Missouri Industrial 
Energy Consumers (MIEC), Midwest Energy Consumers Group (MECG), and Consumers Council of Missouri. In addition to those entities, the commission’s staff, Missouri American Water Company, Laclede Gas Company, Kansas City Power & Light Company, Empower Missouri, and AARP Missouri all offered comments at the hearing. The comments of regulated utilities and utility associations generally supported rescinding the existing rule and replacing it with six (6) new rules. The Office of the Public Counsel and other orga- nizations representing consumers all strongly opposed rescinding the existing rule. 
COMMENT #1: MEDA, the Missouri Cable Telecommunications Association, Missouri American Water Company, Laclede Gas Company, Kansas City Power & Light Company, and Ameren Missouri submitted written or oral comments that are generally sup- portive of the commission’s proposal to rescind the existing rule 4 CSR 240-4.020 and replace it with six (6) new rules. These organi- zations state that the proposal 1) better encourages the free exchange of information; 2) more fairly imposes requirements on all litigants, not just the utilities; and 3) replaces rule language that is unduly complex and difficult to apply in practice. Staff testified at the hear- ing that it mostly supports rescinding the existing rule and replacing it with the proposed new rules which are, compared to the existing rule, more in accordance with section 386.210, RSMo. RESPONSE: The commission agrees that rescinding the existing rule 4 CSR 240-4.020 and replacing it with six (6) new rules furthers the commission’s goals to comply with section 386.210.4, RSMo; sim- plify compliance with the rule; and promote consistency and fairness. 
COMMENT #2: Consumers Council of Missouri, MIEC, MECG, Empower Missouri, AARP, and OPC all strongly oppose rescinding the existing rule 4 CSR 240-4.020, stating that changing the circum- stances under which disclosure and notice of non-public meetings between a commissioner and a utility representative are required will create an appearance of impropriety. OPC provides additional criti- cism of the rescission and replacement rules, stating that the commis- sion already has sufficient mechanisms in place to obtain information from stakeholders and interested persons, and removing disclosure and notice requirements will impair the detection and enforcement of any violations. 
RESPONSE: The commission disagrees with the comment that rescinding the existing rule and replacing it with six (6) new rules will, by itself, lead to either actual impropriety or an appearance of impropriety. Rescission and replacement will better facilitate free communication between any person and commissioners regarding general regulatory policy not related to a pending case; will more fairly and equally impose restrictions on communications between commissioners and participants in the regulatory process; and will properly exclude participants in proceedings other than pending cases, such as rulemakings, working proceedings, and investigations, from those notice and disclosure requirements. The commission has improved and strengthened the prior notice and disclosure require- ments for persons filing cases before the commission.

ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Public Service Commission under sec- tion 386.410, RSMo 2016, the commission adopts a rule as follows:

rule was published in the Missouri Register on January 3, 2017 (42 MoReg 19). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. The proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended February 2, 2017, and on February 16, 2017, the commission held a public hearing on the proposed rule. Timely written comments were received from the Office of the Public Counsel (OPC), the Missouri Energy Development Association (MEDA), the Missouri Cable Telecommunications Association (MCTA), Union Electric Company d/b/a Ameren Missouri (Ameren Missouri), Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers (MIEC), Midwest Energy Consumers Group (MECG), and Consumers Council of Missouri. In addition to those entities, the commission’s staff, Missouri American Water Company, Laclede Gas Company, Kansas City Power & Light Company, Empower Missouri, and AARP Missouri all offered com- ments at the hearing. The comments of regulated utilities and utility associations generally supported the proposed rule, with modifica- tions. The Office of the Public Counsel and other organizations rep- resenting consumers all strongly opposed adopting the proposed rule. 
COMMENT #1: OPC comments that in subsection (1)(A) the words “make a reasonable effort to” should be removed, as such improper communications should be terminated immediately. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees and will make the requested change. 
COMMENT #2: In section (2), Ameren Missouri suggests that two (2) business days should be permitted to make the required filing, as there could be circumstances where personnel needed to provide the information for the filing are not available in sufficient time to pre- pare the filing just one (1) business day after the communication occurs. 
RESPONSE: The commission disagrees with the comment because section 386.210.3, RSMo, requires such filings be made “no later than the next business day following the communication.” No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #3: OPC states that subsection (2)(A) as written per- mits parties guilty of violating ex parte rules to self-select where the notice is filed. The notice should be filed in “all noticed and pending cases” and not just for each discussed case. 
RESPONSE: The commission disagrees with the comment and finds that the appropriate location for filing is in each discussed case. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #4: OPC comments that in section (3), rather than just saying that the filing must be made as soon as practicable, the time to make the filing should be specifically defined, such as by adding the phrase “but no later than three days later”. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees and will make the suggested change. 
COMMENT #5: OPC proposes to add a new section substantially reflecting the wording in the current rule 4 CSR 240-4.020(15) to enable the commission to inquire of parties why sanctions should not be issued for a violation of the rule. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees that the section should be added, but will change the lan- guage of the rule to remove reference to an “anticipated party,” as that term is not used in the proposed rules. 
4 CSR 240-4.020 Ex Parte Communications 
(1) Neither any party nor any member of the office of the commis- sion shall initiate, participate in, or undertake, directly or indirectly, an ex parte communication. 
(A) If such a communication occurs, the party and the member of the office of the commission involved in the communication should immediately terminate the communication. 
(3) If an ex parte communication occurs and the initiating party fails to file a notice in the manner set forth in section (2), any other party or member of the office of the commission involved in the commu- nication, upon learning of the person’s failure to file such notice, shall give notice of the ex parte communication in the manner set forth in section (2) as soon as practicable but no later than three (3) days later. 
(4) The commission may issue an order to show cause why sanctions should not be ordered against any party engaging in an ex parte com- munication.

4 CSR 240-4.030 Extra-Record Communications 
(2) If an extra-record communication occurs and the initiating party fails to file a notice in the manner set forth in section (1), any other party or member of the office of the commission involved in the com- munication, upon learning of the person’s failure to file such notice, shall give notice of the extra-record communication in the manner set forth in section (1) as soon as practicable but no later than three (3) days later.

ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Public Service Commission under sec- tion 386.410, RSMo 2016, the commission adopts a rule as follows: 
4 CSR 240-4.040 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on January 3, 2017 (42 MoReg 20). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. The proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended February 2, 2017, and on February 16, 2017, the commission held a public hearing on the proposed rule. Timely written comments were received from the Office of the Public Counsel (OPC), the Missouri Energy Development Association (MEDA), the Missouri Cable Telecommunications Association (MCTA), Union Electric Company d/b/a Ameren Missouri (Ameren Missouri), Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers (MIEC), Midwest Energy Consumers Group (MECG), and Consumers Council of Missouri. In addition to those entities, the commission’s staff, Missouri American Water Company, Laclede Gas Company, Kansas City Power & Light Company, Empower Missouri, and AARP Missouri all offered comments at the hearing. The comments of regulated utilities and utility associations generally supported the proposed rule, with modifications. The Office of the Public Counsel and other organizations representing consumers all strongly opposed adopting the proposed rule. 
COMMENT #1: OPC comments that in the title of the proposed rule, the words “Public Disclosure of” should be added to reflect OPC’s position that the rule should be focused on public disclosure and not a prohibition on communication. 
RESPONSE: The commission disagrees with the comment because the title does not imply that communications are prohibited and the rule will include no provisions related to disclosure. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #2: In section (1), OPC proposes to replace “pursuant to” with “in accordance with” to more accurately reflect the law because nothing in section 386.210.3, RSMo prohibits restrictions on ex parte communications or enforcement of the current public notice and disclosure provisions. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees and will make the suggested change. 
COMMENT #3: OPC proposes the following changes to the text of section (1): a) the phrase “on substantive or procedural matters that are the subject of a pending filing in a case in which no evidentiary hearing has been scheduled are permitted and need not be disclosed” should be added in the first sentence of section (1) after “communi- 
cation” (and delete the preceding word “no”) to make clear that com- munications made in accordance with 386.210.3, RSMo have been deemed adequately disclosed to the public and need no further process to disclose; b) the phrase “shall be prohibited by, or subject to, the dis- closure and notice requirements of rule 4 CSR 240-4.020 or 4 CSR 240-4.030” should be deleted because it does not reflect an accurate reading of the law and would permit communication that should be publicly disclosed to remain secret thus eroding the public trust in the commission; c) the word “only” should be inserted to indicate that communications that do not require public disclosure under the rules are limited to the processes specifically identified in the statute indi- cating when communications are deemed to be sufficiently disclosed to the public; and d) the phrase “made before an evidentiary hearing has been scheduled in the case and are” should be deleted because OPC includes it in a different location in the sentence. 
RESPONSE: The commission disagrees with the comment because the suggested changes are inconsistent with the language in this pro- posed rule and similar related proposed rules. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #4: OPC proposed that a new subsection be added sub- stantially similar to the existing commission rule 4 CSR 240-4.020(8) to ensure that communications between the commission and repre- sentatives of regulated utilities are disclosed to the public. OPC and MEDA propose that language be added to identify specific situations where communications between the commission and a representative of a regulated utility need not be disclosed. This is similar to the wording of some of the current rule provisions at 4 CSR 240- 4.020(10). MEDA agrees that the specific “safe harbor” provisions in the current rule 4 CSR 240-4.020(10) should be included in the new rules. MIEC stated an opinion at the hearing that the existing safe harbor provisions are not contrary to section 386.210, RSMo. RESPONSE: The commission disagrees with the comment because the commission finds the suggested changes to be inconsistent with the language in this proposed rule, similar related proposed rules, and section 386.210, RSMo. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
4 CSR 240-4.040 Communications that are not Ex Parte or Extra-Record Communications 
(1) In accordance with section 386.210.3, RSMo, no communication shall be prohibited by, or subject to, the disclosure and notice requirements of rule 4 CSR 240-4.020 or 4 CSR 240-4.030, if those communications are made before an evidentiary hearing has been scheduled in the case and are— 
(A) Made at a public agenda meeting of the commission where such matter has been posted in advance as an item for discussion or decision; or 
(B) Made at a forum where representatives of the public utility affected thereby, the Office of the Public Counsel, and any other party to the case are present.

rule was published in the Missouri Register on January 3, 2017 (42 MoReg 20–21). No changes have been made in the text of the pro- posed rule, so it is not reprinted here. The proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended February 2, 2017, and on February 16, 2017, the commission held a public hearing on the proposed rule. Timely written comments were received from the Office of the Public Counsel (OPC), the Missouri Energy Development Association (MEDA), the Missouri Cable Telecommunications Association (MCTA), Union Electric Company d/b/a Ameren Missouri (Ameren Missouri), Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers (MIEC), Midwest Energy Consumers Group (MECG), and Consumers Council of Missouri. In addition to those entities, the commission’s staff, Missouri American Water Company, Laclede Gas Company, Kansas City Power & Light Company, Empower Missouri, and AARP Missouri all offered comments at the hearing. The comments of regulated utilities and utility associations generally supported the proposed rule. The Office of the Public Counsel and other organizations representing consumers all strongly opposed adopting the proposed rule. 
COMMENT #1: OPC comments that in the title of the proposed rule, the words “and Prohibited Acts” should be added to the title to reflect OPC’s recommended additions in the rule describing acts pro- hibited by the commissioners. 
RESPONSE: The commission disagrees with the comment because it does not find that OPC’s recommended additions describing pro- hibited acts are appropriate. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #2: OPC proposes that the word “contested” should be deleted and the words “or filing” should be added to make the limi- tation apply to all filings at the commission, not just contested cases. RESPONSE: These comments were accommodated by revising the definition of “case” in proposed rule 4 CSR 240-4.015 and removing references to “contested case” throughout the proposed rules. No changes have been made to this rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #3: OPC proposes that four (4) new sections should be added. Section (2) should be added to incorporate the standards of conduct contained in sections 105.462, 105.464, and 105.455, RSMo, as modified to be specific to the commission. Section (3) should be added to provide additional standards and make clear when a commissioner must recuse himself or herself from a proceeding in order to maintain the public trust. Section (4) should be added to establish the process for a party to move to disqualify or seek recusal of a commissioner. Section (5) should be added to provide guidance as to whether orders in which a conflicted commissioner participates are impacted. 
RESPONSE: The commission disagrees with the comment because the suggested new provisions are outside the scope of the subject mat- ter of this proposed rule. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment.

Transportation Commission received one (1) comment on the pro- posed amendment. 
COMMENT #1: Steven Todd, with the Specialized Carriers & Rigging Association, requested that rule language in subsection (15)(G) be revised to eliminate or reduce the escort requirements for loads greater than one hundred sixty thousand (160,000) pounds. Todd stated that most states do not have any automatic escort require- ments for “weight only” loads. Todd further stated that eliminating or reducing Missouri’s escort requirements would enhance the effi- cient movement of freight and, as other states have demonstrated, there has been no negative impact to safety. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission concurs with this com- ment and subsection (15)(G) will be changed to allow travel for over- weight loads up to three hundred fifty thousand (350,000) pounds before escorts are required on the interstate. 
7 CSR 10-25.020 Oversize/Overweight Permits 
(15) Super Heavy and Large Load Movement. Loads in excess of routine permit limits will be considered according to the following regulations when air, rail, or water terminal points are not available: 
(G) Escort Requirements. If Missouri State Highway Patrol escorts are required for a continuous portion of the move, but not the entire move, they are only required for that portion. If the patrol escort is required for an intermittent portion of the move, they will be required to escort the entire move. In addition to escort requirements as out- lined in subsection (9)(G), the following requirements apply to super heavy and large load movements: 
1. One (1) front and one (1) rear civilian escort is required for all superloads in excess of three hundred fifty thousand (350,000) lbs.; 
2. One (1) front civilian escort is required for all superloads on two- (2-) lane highways, except— 
3. If a load is required to cross bridge structures at crawl speed in the Kansas City and St. Louis areas, then one (1) front and two (2) rear civilian escorts are required for that portion of the move; 
4. One (1) front and two (2) rear civilian escorts are required on all sections of dual lane highways traversed if load exceeds sixteen feet (16') wide and Missouri State Highway Patrol escorts are not present. If Missouri State Highway Patrol escorts are present, one (1) front and one (1) rear civilian escort is required. In addition to the civilian escorts required above— 
5. Missouri State Highway Patrol escorts are required when load exceeds: 
A. Sixteen feet (16') wide on any highway other than inter- state or MO 370; 
B. Eighteen feet (18') wide on interstate or MO 370; 
C. One hundred fifty feet (150') overall length on any high- way; 
D. Seventeen feet (17') high on any highway; or 
E. Any time deemed necessary due to complexity of route or load. The Missouri State Highway Patrol may conduct a Level I inspection prior to performing escort services. Motor Carrier Services may, at their discretion, waive Missouri State Highway Patrol escort requirement or allow the substitution of local or military law enforce- ment in the place of Missouri State Highway Patrol escorts;

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission received two (2) comments on the pro- posed amendment. 
COMMENT #1: Comments received from the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) indicate that the proposed revisions to section (1) and subsections (1)(A) and (1)(C) that reference 23 CFR Part 1300.25(e) are inconsistent with 302.134, RSMo and recommends that the references be removed. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: MoDOT did not seek to create confusion with the proposed amendment revisions and will remove the references to 23 CFR Part 1300.25(e) from the final order of rulemaking. 
COMMENT #2: Mr. John Skala commented that incorporating the reference to 23 CFR Part 1300.25(e) in section (1) is inapplicable because the reference deals only with beginning rider courses and not experienced or advanced courses. He also stated that by requiring the most current version, there may be multiple current versions and not allow time to transition to the most current version. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: MoDOT did not seek to create confusion with the proposed amendment revisions and will remove the references to 23 CFR Part 1300.25(e) from the final order of rulemaking. MoDOT believes the reference to the most cur- rent version of the MSF courses is appropriate and sufficient, so no change is necessary.
