Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2200—State Board of Nursing Chapter 4—General Rules 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2200-4.020 Requirements for Licensure. The board is 
amending sections (1) and (5). 
PURPOSE: This amendment is to recognize the Air Force Basic Medical Technician Corpsman Program 4N051 – 5 Skill Level and above to meet educational standards/academic preparation for licen- sure as a practical nurse. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: Section 536.025, RSMo, sets forth the standards for an emergency rule, which are strict. However, one (1) of the criteria is that the agency must find that the rule is necessary to preserve a compelling governmental interest that requires an early effective date. The language contained in section 324.007, RSMo, requires the Missouri State Board of Nursing to accept education, training, or service completed by an individual who is a member of the United States Armed Forces or Reserves, the National Guard of any state, the military reserves of any state, or the naval militia of any state. The Missouri State Board of Nursing determined that this emer- gency rule is necessary for military service members with prior mili- tary education, training, and service to gain timely authorization to 
practice nursing. In late 2016, official evidence became available that the Air Force – BMTCP – 4N051 program beginning at 5-skill level meets standards for practical nurse education; this rule change would provide academic eligibility for military service members that have completed the Air Force BMTCP – 4N051 program with 5-skill level or above designation to apply to take the practical nurse licensure exam and therefore, upon passing of the exam, fill an immediate need in the nursing workforce. The Air Force reports that there are approximately twenty-seven (27) individuals who would be ready to apply for licen- sure, if the rule was in effect. Bothwell Hospital in Sedalia is in need of nurses and would be very interested in putting them to work. The individuals who would otherwise be eligible may leave Missouri or may transfer to another state by the time that this rule is promulgated under the normal procedures. Emergency rule processes would allow for a one hundred eighty- (180-) day window and the potential of at least twenty-seven (27) new LPNs in Missouri with the potential for jobs at Bothwell or other Missouri healthcare institutions. Air Force reports indicate that nation-wide there may be in excess of ten thousand (10,000) service members with this designation. 
The scope of this emergency amendment is limited to the circum- stances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The Missouri State Board of Nursing believes this emergency amendment is fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency amendment was filed April 27, 2017, becomes effec- tive May 9, 2017, and expires February 15, 2018. 
(1) Examination. (B) The registered professional nurse (RN) candidate shall have 
successfully completed the basic prescribed curriculum and received a degree or diploma from a school with an [accredited] approved professional nursing program.

A candidate cannot take the licensure examination until all licensure requirements are met, including providing a transcript. 
(5) Licensure by Endorsement in Missouri—Registered Nurses (RNs) and Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs). 
(A) A professional/practical nurse licensed in another state or ter- ritory of the United States shall be entitled to licensure provided qualifications are equivalent to the requirements of Missouri at the time of original licensure. This equivalency shall be defined as— 
1. Evidence of completion and graduation from an [accredit- ed] approved program of professional/practical nursing if educated in a state of the United States; a course-by-course evaluation report received directly from a credentials evaluation service approved by the board or a Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS) certificate if the initial nursing education was earned in a territory, Canada, or another country; 
2. Attainment of a passing standard score or pass designation as determined by the Missouri State Board of Nursing on the licensing examination or attainment of an acceptable grade in areas compara- ble to those required in Missouri at the time licensure was secured in the state of original licensure; 
3. Evidence of completion of the applicable secondary educa- tion set forth in section 335.046, RSMo, requirements or the equiv- alent as determined by the State Department of Education; 
4. Applicants who are not citizens of the United States who have completed programs in schools of professional/practical nursing in states which require citizenship for licensure may take the National Council Licensure Examination for professional/practical nurses in Missouri if they meet all of Missouri’s requirements; and 
5. If an individual was licensed by waiver as a practical/voca- tional nurse in another state, territory, or foreign country prior to 
July 1, 1955, and the individual meets the requirements for licensure as a practical nurse in Missouri which were in effect at the time the individual was licensed in the other jurisdiction, she/he is eligible for licensure in Missouri as an LPN. If an individual is licensed by waiv- er in another state after July 1, 1955, she/he does not qualify for licensure by waiver in Missouri as a practical nurse.

Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

Title 4—DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Division 240—Public Service Commission Chapter 2—Practice and Procedure 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Public Service Commission under sec- tions 386.040 and 386.410, RSMo 2016, the commission amends a rule as follows: 
4 CSR 240-2.135 is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on January 3, 2017 (42 MoReg 14–17). Changes to the proposed amendment are reprinted here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The public comment period ended February 2, 2017, and the commission held a public hearing on the proposed amendment on February 16, 2017. The commission received timely written comments from the Missouri Cable Telecommunications Association (MCTA) and Kansas City Power & Light Company (KCP&L) and KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company (GMO). In addition, the commission received a written comment from attorney Carl Lumley on November 23, 2016. Although that comment was submitted before the proposed amendment was published in the Register, the commission will respond to it in this order. Jim Fischer, representing KCP&L/GMO; Rick Zucker, representing Laclede Gas and Missouri Gas Energy (Laclede/MGE); Tim Opitz, representing the Office of the Public Counsel; Chris Moody, on behalf of MCTA; 
and Mark Johnson, representing the commission’s staff, appeared at the hearing and offered comments. 
COMMENT #1: The comments from MCTA, KCPL/GMO, and Laclede/MGE share an overarching concern that the rule should con- tinue to protect competitively sensitive information from disclosure to employees of competing parties who are engaged in strategic mar- keting and planning. The existing rule does that by creating two (2) categories of confidential information: proprietary and highly confi- dential. Information that is designated as highly confidential can be disclosed only to attorneys and outside experts and not be viewed by employees, officers, or directors of the party. Information that should not be made public but which is not competitively sensitive is supposed to be designated as proprietary under the existing rule. 
MCTA, KCPL/GMO, and Laclede/MGE would like the enhanced protections for highly confidential information to remain in the rule. Jim Fischer, speaking for KCPL/GMO, was particularly concerned that the commission not go back to routinely issuing “standard pro- tective orders” in every case, as was the practice before the current confidential information rule went into effect in 2006. Fischer believes it would be a waste of resources for the parties to have to negotiate and propose a protective order that can instead be estab- lished by rule. 
RESPONSE: The new rule will continue to allow for the protection from disclosure of confidential information to persons that should not be allowed to view that information. But, the new rule will discour- age the practice of routinely over-designating information as highly confidential. 
Proprietary was intended to be the routine designation for confi- dential information under the existing rule. The highly confidential designation was supposed to be reserved for information deserving of a higher level of protection. Unfortunately, over the years, parties have found it easier to simply designate all confidential information as highly confidential. As one (1) attorney-commenter explained at the hearing, “if I’ve designated something HC that wasn’t, not much happens. But if I fail to designate something HC that was, then I get in some trouble back home.” 
The new rule tries to correct that over-designation problem by list- ing only one (1) set of categories that will receive standard protec- tions, which is called “confidential” information in the new rule. If a party believes that certain information should have a higher level of protection, the proposed rule allows the party to file a motion explaining what information must be protected and why. The intent is that the parties can negotiate the appropriate measures to protect that information from improper disclosure. They can then present their agreement to the commission for approval. Or, if they cannot agree, they can present their arguments to the commission for reso- lution of disputes regarding the details of how particular information should be protected. In that way, the increased protection afforded to highly confidential information can be limited to the information that truly needs to be protected and the public’s right to know the infor- mation that forms the basis for the commission’s decisions can be preserved. No change was made in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #2: Paragraph (1)(B)5. of the existing rule, re-designat- ed as paragraph (2)(A)5. of the proposed rule, defines “reports, work papers, or other documents related to work produced by external auditors, consultants or attorneys” as confidential. The amended rule would add that “total amounts billed by each external auditor, con- sultant, or attorney shall always be public.” KCPL/GMO expressed concern that this revision could conflict with the attorney-client priv- ilege as it would apply to attorneys. It also believes the rule is over- broad in saying that all such bills must be public even outside the context of a rate case in which the utility might be trying to recover the cost of such reports. In other words, if a company wants to use shareholder funds to perform a study, or if the study costs were 
874 
 
June 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 11 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 875 

incurred outside a rate case test-year, those costs should not need to be made public. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion intended that this provision make public auditor, consultant, and attorney fees that a utility is seeking to recover from its ratepayers in the context of a rate case. It agrees with the comment to the extent that such fees not associated with a rate case do not always need to be made public. The commission will modify paragraph (2)(A)5. to limit its application to “services related to general rate proceedings.” 
COMMENT #3: MCTA expressed concern that section (4) presumes that all information must be disclosed to the parties in some way because it requires an explanation of how the information “shall” be disclosed to the parties that require the information. It points out that the FCC has found some information so confidential that it should not be disclosed to anyone other than to the commission. MCTA sug- gests the language be modified to recognize that in some circum- stances less, or even non-disclosure, may be appropriate. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion understands that some information should be afforded extraordi- nary levels of protection and the rule would allow the commission to order such levels of protection in appropriate circumstances. The commission will alleviate MCTA’s concerns by changing “shall be disclosed” to “may be disclosed,” and deleting the clause that sug- gests some parties may require the information. 
COMMENT #4: Subsection (4)(A) is intended to protect information from disclosure while a motion seeking a greater level of protection is pending. It does so by limiting disclosure to attorneys and outside experts, which is the restriction on disclosure of highly confidential information under the current rule. MCTA commented that some information may be entitled to even greater protection and should not be disclosed to anyone before the commission has a chance to rule on the request. MCTA suggests the subsection be modified to allow the party making the request to simply describe the information to be protected until the commission decides what limitations on disclosure should be afforded. Public counsel commented that such a descrip- tion of the information for which protection is sought would have to be sufficiently detailed to allow other parties to respond to the motion. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with the comments. The subsection will be modified to allow information to be protected from disclosure in the manner sought in the motion while the commission considers that motion. The modification will also require the moving party to provide a detailed summary of the information at issue. 
COMMENT #5: Subsection (5)(B) of the proposed amendment requires a party designating discovery information as confidential to describe how “each piece” of that information qualifies as confiden- tial under the rule. KCPL/GMO is concerned that requiring a description of the confidentiality of “each piece” of information could require excessive detail and could lead to additional disputes among the parties. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with the comment. The subsection will be modified to remove the phrase “each piece of” from the requirement of an expla- nation of how information qualifies as confidential. 
COMMENT #6: Laclede/MGE questioned the deletion of existing subsection (3)(C), which states that the rule does not require disclo- sure of information that would otherwise be protected from disclo- sure by any privilege or other rule regarding discovery. Laclede/MGE suggests such provision is essential. 
RESPONSE: The commission agrees that this rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected from discovery. But this subsection is no longer necessary because that protection is now recognized in the first section of the new rule. No change was made in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #7: MCTA is concerned that the proposed amendment would allow employees of competitive companies to view highly con- fidential, competitively sensitive information. It urges the commis- sion to add restrictions to section (6) to prohibit the release of such information to employees of a party who are engaged in marketing or strategic planning activities. 
RESPONSE: The commission recognizes that competitively sensitive information may need a higher level of protection from disclosure. The proposed amendment allows for a higher level of protection if the disclosing party wants to seek such protections. For that reason the protections sought by MCTA do not need to be included in the rule. No change was made in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #8: The proposed amendment deletes section (5) of the existing rule. That section describes the circumstances in which high- ly confidential information should be handled and disclosed to par- ties. KCPL/GMO and MCTA argue that the existing rule’s provisions regarding the handling of highly confidential information are helpful and generally accepted by all parties appearing before the commis- sion. They suggest there is no reason to require the parties to rene- gotiate these provisions in every case. 
RESPONSE: The commission agrees that the provisions contained in the deleted section may appropriately be included in a motion for additional protection beyond what is provided in section (2) of the rule. But, the use of such provisions should be considered by the commission on a case-by-case basis when deciding whether to grant such a request. They do not need to be included in the rule and the section will be deleted. No change was made in response to this com- ment. 
COMMENT #9: Carl Lumley points out an error in section (7) of the proposed amendment. The section requires a written certificate of “such expert or party.” Earlier in the section reference is made to experts and employees of a party. The second reference should also be to “employee of a party,” rather than just “party.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with the comment and will correct the error. 
COMMENT #10: Section (10) of the proposed amendment continues the existing rule’s description of how confidential information is to be delineated in prefiled testimony. Carl Lumley comments that the same delineation requirements should also apply to other documents filed with the commission, such as briefs and pleadings. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commission agrees with the comment and will add a new subsection (10)(D) that will apply the same delineation requirements to briefs and pleadings. 
COMMENT #11: Carl Lumley comments that section (11) is limited to challenges to the designation of confidential information in discov- ery or testimony. He suggests it should also apply to briefs and plead- ings. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The commis- sion agrees with the comment, and section (11) will be made to apply to briefs and pleadings as well as discovery and testimony. 
COMMENT #12: Section (13) of the existing rule allows a party responding to a discovery request to require that voluminous or hard to copy information be reviewed on its premises or at some other location. That section is deleted from the proposed amendment. KCPL/GMO asks that the section be retained in the new rule, con- tending that it has proven to be useful. 
RESPONSE: The commission agrees that provisions of this section regarding voluminous or hard to copy information may be useful. However, they are not related to a question of confidentiality and thus do not belong in this rule. No change was made in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #13: Staff pointed to a section of statute that references 

Page 876 
June 1, 2017 Vol. 42, No. 11 

Orders of Rulemaking 

“proprietary” information at the commission. Paragraph 392.550.3(7)(c), RSMo 2016 requires a registrant seeking to provide interconnected voice over internet protocol service to give the com- mission certain information and requires the commission to maintain that information as “proprietary” and not available to the public. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The revised rule will no longer recognize a “propriety” designation for confiden- tial information, but the new “confidential” designation will still pro- tect that information from public disclosure as contemplated by the statute. The commission will add a new section (20) to clarify that any reference to proprietary or highly confidential information in any statute or other regulation of this commission shall be interpreted as a reference to confidential information under this rule. 
COMMENT #14: Public counsel generally supports the revisions to the rule to ensure that information that should be available to the pub- lic is not improperly designated as confidential or highly confiden- tial. In particular, Public counsel applauds the removal of the time limits on the filing of challenges to confidential designation of infor- mation. 
RESPONSE: The commission thanks Public counsel for its com- ment. No change was made in response to this comment. 
COMMENT #15: In reviewing the proposed amendment, the com- mission notes that words are missing from subsection (2)(B). The subsection should require a reference to the “paragraph of” 4 CSR 240-2.135(2)(A) through which the information is protected. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The missing words have been added to subsection (2)(B). 
4 CSR 240-2.135 Confidential Information 
(2) Confidential Designation. (A) Any person may submit to the commission, without first 
obtaining a protective order, information designated as confidential if that information is— 
1. Customer-specific information; 2. Employee-sensitive personnel information; 3. Marketing analysis or other market-specific information 
relating to services offered in competition with others; 4. Marketing analysis or other market-specific information relating to goods or services purchased or acquired for use by a com- 
pany in providing services to customers; 5. Reports, work papers, or other documentation related to

6. Strategies employed, to be employed, or under consideration in contract negotiations; 
7. Relating to the security of a company’s facilities; or 
8. Concerning trade secrets, as defined in section 417.453, RSMo. 
(B) Any information designated as confidential shall be submitted with a cover sheet or pleading describing how such information qual- ifies as confidential under subsection (2)(A) of this rule, including the specific subsection relied upon and an explanation of its applica- bility. Only the specific information that qualifies as confidential shall be designated as such. In addition, each document that contains confidential information shall bear the designation “Confidential” and the paragraph(s) of 4 CSR 240-2.135(2)(A) through which that information is protected. 
(4) The commission may order greater protection than that provided by a confidential designation upon a motion explaining what infor- mation must be protected, the harm to the disclosing entity or the public that might result from disclosure of the information, and an explanation of how the information may be disclosed while protecting 
the interests of the disclosing entity and the public. (A) While such a motion is pending, the disclosing party request- 
ing greater protection will be afforded the protection sought. However, in all circumstances, the disclosing party must, at a mini- mum, provide a detailed summary of the information at issue. 
(B) Any document that contains such information shall bear the designation “Highly Confidential,” rather than “Confidential,” but shall otherwise follow the formatting delineated in section (10) of this rule. 
(5) When a party seeks discovery of information that the party from whom discovery is sought believes to be confidential, the party from whom discovery is sought may designate the information confidential. 
(A) No order from the commission is necessary before a party in any case pending before the commission may designate discovery responses confidential, and such information shall be protected as provided in this rule. 
(B) The party that designates discovery information confidential shall inform, in writing, the party seeking discovery how that infor- mation qualifies as confidential under subsection (2)(A) of this rule at the same time it responds to the discovery request. If the party seeking discovery disagrees with the designation placed on the infor- mation, that party shall follow the informal discovery dispute resolu- tion procedures set forth in 4 CSR 240-2.090(8). If the party seeking discovery exhausts these dispute resolution procedures, that party may file a motion challenging the designation. 
(7) Any employee of a party or outside expert retained by a party that wishes to review confidential information shall first certify in writing that such expert or employee of a party will comply with the require- ments of this rule. 
(A) The certification shall include the signatory’s full name, per- manent address, title or position, date signed, the case number of the case for which the signatory will view the information, and the iden- tity of the party for whom the signatory is acting. 
(C) The party seeking disclosure of the confidential information shall provide a copy of the certificate to the disclosing party before disclosure is made. 
(10) Any prefiled testimony that contains information designated as confidential shall be filed with both a public and a nonpublic version as follows: 
(A) For the public version, the confidential portions shall be removed. The removal of confidential information shall be indicated by underlining and two (2) asterisks before and after the confidential information, e.g., **confidential information removed**. The desig- nated information shall be removed in such a way that the lineation and pagination of the public version remains the same as the confi- dential version; 
(B) For the nonpublic version of the prefiled testimony, the confi- dential information shall be indicated by underlining and by two (2) asterisks before and after the confidential information, e.g., **con- fidential information**; 
(C) At the hearing, the party offering the prefiled testimony shall present a public version of the testimony in which the confidential portions are removed. The public version of the testimony will be marked as Exhibit ___. The offering party shall also present a sepa- rate copy of the prefiled testimony containing confidential informa- tion, sealed in an envelope. The version of the testimony containing confidential information will be marked as Exhibit ___C. 
(D) These delineation requirements shall also be used when desig- nating confidential portions of pleadings and briefs. 
(11) At any time after the filing of discovery, testimony, brief, or pleading that contains information designated as confidential, the commission may challenge the designation of the discovery, testimo- ny, brief, or pleading. A party may also challenge such a designation at any time by filing an appropriate motion with the commission.

If granted, the SPE Certificates will authorize these individuals to qual- ify as drivers of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs), in intrastate commerce only, without meeting the vision standard prescribed in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(10), if applicable, or the diabetes standard prescribed in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(3).

Background 
The individuals listed in this notice have recently filed applications requesting MoDOT to issue SPE Certificates to exempt them from the physical qualification requirements relating to vision in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(10), or to diabetes in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(3), which other- wise apply to drivers of CMVs in Missouri intrastate commerce. 
Under section 622.555, RSMo, MoDOT may issue an SPE Certificate, for not more than a two- (2-) year period, if it finds that the applicant has the ability, while operating CMVs, to maintain a level of safety that is equivalent to or greater than the driver qualifi- cation standards of 49 CFR 391.41. Upon application, MoDOT may renew an exemption upon expiration. 
Accordingly, the agency will evaluate the qualifications of each appli- cant to determine whether issuing an SPE Certificate will comply with the statutory requirements and will achieve the required level of safety. If granted, the SPE Certificate is only applicable to intrastate transportation wholly within Missouri.
