HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO 
RULES 
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system– 
Title Division Chapter Rule 
3 CSR 10- 4 .115 Department Code of Agency General area Specific area 
State Division regulated regulated Regulations 
and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115. 
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a. 
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation, for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115 NOT Rule 10-4.115. Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated.

Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

The ser- vices covered and not covered, the limitations under which services are covered, and the maximum allowable fees for all covered services shall be determined by the division and shall be included in the MO HealthNet provider manuals, which are incorporated by reference and made a part of this rule as published by the Department of Social Services, MO HealthNet Division, 615 Howerton Court, Jefferson City, MO 65109, at its website dss.mo.gov/mhd, [November 16, 2015] October 1, 2017. This rule does not incorporate any subse- quent amendments or additions. 
(3) Program Violations. (A) Sanctions may be imposed by the MO HealthNet agency 
against a provider for any one (1) or more of the following reasons: 1. Presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment any false or fraudulent claim for services or merchandise in the course of busi- 
ness related to MO HealthNet; 2. Submitting, or causing to be submitted, false information for 
the purpose of obtaining greater compensation than that to which the provider is entitled under applicable MO HealthNet program policies or rules, including, but not limited to, the billing or coding of ser- vices which results in payments in excess of the fee schedule for the service actually provided or billing or coding of services which results in payments in excess of the provider’s charges to the general public for the same services or billing for higher level of service or increased number of units from those actually ordered or performed 
or both, or altering or falsifying medical records to obtain or verify a greater payment than authorized by a fee schedule or reimburse- ment plan;

Failure shall be documented by repeat dis- crepancies. The discrepancies may be determined by a peer review committee, medical review teams, independent professional review teams, utilization review committees, or by Professional Standards Review Organizations (PSRO). The medical review may be conducted by qualified peers employed by the single state agency; 
6. Engaging in conduct or performing an act deemed improper or abusive of the MO HealthNet program or continuing the conduct following notification that the conduct should cease. This will include inappropriate or improper actions relating to the management of participants’ personal funds or other funds;

The applicant has the burden of providing the information necessary for determination of this issue. 
1. The applicant for licensure by reciprocity shall furnish to the committee true and accurate copies of the licensure law from the state in which he/she is licensed and/or certified;

The denial letter shall identify the reasons for denial and shall inform the applicant of the appeal process. 
(3) Any applicant for licensure shall complete and officially file the application for licensure within an application window of one (1) year from the date the application is initially submitted to the committee.

Orders of Rulemaking 

Auditor’s Office concurs that clarification is necessary. Subsection (8)(D) will be amended and subsection (8)(E) shall be added for clar- ity. 
15 CSR 40-3.170 Addendum Filed with the Auditor’s Office 
(8) Examples. (D) All ordinance violations for a city are adjudicated in the asso- 
ciate circuit division and not by a municipal division operated by that city. Because the city does not operate its own municipal court divi- sion, it does not need to file an addendum with its financial report filed under the procedures in 15 CSR 40-3.030. 
(E) All ordinance violations for a City A are adjudicated in a municipal division located in City B under an agreement between the two cities. Because City A operates a municipal division through this agreement, City A must file an addendum with its financial report filed under the procedures in 15 CSR 40-3.030.
