Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

(5) The Director shall score each applicant according to the following point system. 
(B) For years of experience as [an active, full-time] a commis- sioned peace officer:

The director of public safety is amending sec- tion (2) and subsection (4)(E) so the listed training topics match the training topics found in the proposed amendment to 11 CSR 75- 15.010. The director of public safety is also amending subsection (4)(G) by removing the requirement that the instructor’s name must appear on the certificate of training completion and replacing it with the previous requirement that the name of the individual responsible for the general administration of the course must appear on the cer- tificate of training completion.

well-being, including mental health and/or physical health aware- ness; fair and impartial policing practices, including implicit bias recognition; handling persons with mental health [and] or cognitive impairment issues; and tactical training [to], which must include one (1) or more of the following areas: de-escalation techniques, crisis management, critical thinking, or social intelligence shall also be designated as such, in addition to being designated by curric- ula area. 
(4) Upon successful completion of the requirements of any CLEE course, the provider of the training shall report to the director the successful completion of the CLEE course by the trainee in a method to be determined by the director and shall present each trainee a cer- tificate bearing— 
(E) The number of racial profiling, firearms, officer well-being, including mental health and/or physical health awareness; fair and impartial policing practices, including implicit bias recognition; han- dling persons with mental health [and] or cognitive impairment issues; and tactical training [to], which must include one (1) or more of the following areas: de-escalation techniques, crisis man- agement, critical thinking, or social intelligence CLEE credit hours earned, if any; 
(G) The name of the individual [instructing the course] respon- sible for general administration of the course; and
