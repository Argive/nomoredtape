Background 
The individuals listed in this notice have recently filed applications requesting MoDOT to issue SPE Certificates to exempt them from the physical qualification requirements relating to vision in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(10), or to diabetes in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(3), which other- wise apply to drivers of CMVs in Missouri intrastate commerce. 
Under section 622.555, RSMo, MoDOT may issue an SPE Certificate, for not more than a two- (2-) year period, if it finds that the applicant has the ability, while operating CMVs, to maintain a level of safety that is equivalent to or greater than the driver qualifi- cation standards of 49 CFR 391.41.

Background 
The individuals listed in this notice have recently filed applications requesting MoDOT to issue SPE Certificates to exempt them from the physical qualification requirements relating to vision in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(10), or to diabetes in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(3), which other- wise apply to drivers of CMVs in Missouri intrastate commerce. 
Under section 622.555, RSMo, MoDOT may issue an SPE Certificate, for not more than a two- (2-) year period, if it finds that the applicant has the ability, while operating CMVs, to maintain a level of safety that is equivalent to or greater than the driver qualifi- cation standards of 49 CFR 391.41. Upon application, MoDOT may renew an exemption upon expiration. 
Accordingly, the agency will evaluate the qualifications of each appli- cant to determine whether issuing an SPE Certificate will comply with the statutory requirements and will achieve the required level of safety. If granted, the SPE Certificate is only applicable to intrastate transportation wholly within Missouri.

Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION 
IN ADDITION 
Pursuant to section 376.1224, RSMo, regarding the maximum pre- scribed insurance benefit for the coverage of applied behavior analysis for the treatment of autism, the director of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration is required to calculate the new maximum each year to adjust for inflation. 
Using Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers, as required by section 376.1224, RSMo, the new maximum required benefit was established by the following calculation: 
Index Based on 1984 Dollars CPI for 2015: 219.321 CPI for 2016: 221.075 
New ABA Mandated Maximum Benefit = 2016 Limit × (2016 Annual Index/2015 Annual Index) 
$43,478 × (221.075/219.321) = $43,826
