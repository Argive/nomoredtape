Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 15—ELECTED OFFICIALS Division 30—Secretary of State Chapter 120—Family Trust Company 
EMERGENCY RULE 15 CSR 30-120.010 Definitions 
PURPOSE: This rule defines certain terms used in the administration of the Missouri Family Trust Company Act and in the corresponding rules, forms, and orders made. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The secretary of state determines that this emergency rule is necessary to preserve a compelling governmen- tal interest. 
This emergency rule is necessary to address statutory sections enacted in HB 292 (2017), specifically sections 362.1010 to 362.1115, RSMo, which become law on August 28, 2017, and create a frame- work for the creation and operation of family trust companies desir- ing to operate in Missouri. A family trust company is a corporation or limited liability company organized or qualified to do business in the state of Missouri that is wholly owned and exclusively controlled by, directly or indirectly, one (1) or more family members, excluding any former spouse of a family member; that operates for the exclusive benefit of a family member regardless of whether compensation is received or anticipated; and that does not engage in trust company business with the general public or otherwise hold itself out as a trustee for hire by advertisement, solicitation, or other means. 
The secretary of state needs this emergency rule to ensure that fam- ily trust companies are created in accordance with the appropriate rules and regulations. This emergency rule clarifies definitions used in the administration of the act and in the corresponding rules, forms, and orders made, which will allow the secretary of state to ensure compliance with sections 362.1010 to 362.1115, RSMo. 
The secretary of state finds there is a compelling governmental interest, which requires this emergency action. A proposed rule, which covers the same material, is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. The scope of this emergency rule is limited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protec- tions extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The secretary of state believes this emergency rule is fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency rule was filed August 15, 2017, becomes effective August 28, 2017, and expires February 22, 2018. 
(1) As used in this chapter or in the forms prescribed by this chapter, the words defined in section 362.1015, RSMo, shall have the same meaning, and the following terms and phrases (whether or not capi- talized) shall have the meanings stated below unless the context clear- ly indicates otherwise: 
(A) “Affiliate” means any company that owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership or control by any company that owns or controls, a family trust company or foreign family trust company; 
(B) “Applicant” means the corporation or limited liability compa- ny on whose behalf an application to register as a family trust com- pany is submitted under section 362.1030, RSMo; or the corporation or limited liability company on whose behalf an application to regis- ter as foreign family trust company is submitted under section 362.1030, RSMo; 
(C) “Cash” means legal tender, coin, demand deposit accounts, and time-deposit accounts, as valued in United States dollars; 
(D) “Company” means any corporation, association, partnership, limited liability company, business trust, sole proprietorship, joint venture, or charitable organization or foundation, or other similar organization or business entity; 
(E) “Holding company” means any company which owns or con- trols a family trust company or foreign family trust company; 
(F) “Owns” or “controls” means owns, controls, or has power to vote twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of voting secu- rities or membership interests of a company or family trust company or foreign family trust company; or controls in any manner the elec- tion of a majority of the directors, or managers or other similar gov- erning body of a company or family trust company or foreign family trust company; owns, controls, or has power to vote ten percent (10%) or more of any class of voting securities or membership inter- ests of a company or family trust company or foreign family trust company and exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the company or family trust company or foreign family trust company; or as determined by the secretary; and 
(G) “Third-party service provider” means any person or company that has entered into a business relationship with a family trust com- pany or foreign family trust company, for the provision of services, or any person or company that has entered into a business relation- ship with an affiliate of a family trust company or foreign family trust company, for the provision of services.

Emergency Rules 

Title 19—DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SENIOR SERVICES Division 30—Division of Regulation and Licensure Chapter 40—Comprehensive Emergency Medical Services Systems Regulations 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 
19 CSR 30-40.720 Stroke Center Designation Application and Review. The department is amending sections (1), (2), and (3) and renumbering throughout; adding a new section (3); and adding the form included after the rule. 
PURPOSE: This amendment adds an option and establishes require- ments for hospitals which are certified as stroke centers by the Joint Commission, DNV-GL Healthcare or Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program to become designated as level I, II, or III stroke centers without being reviewed by DHSS (the department). This amendment also adds an application for these hospitals which are certified as stroke centers by the Joint Commission, DNV-GL Healthcare or Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program to com- plete in order to become designated as level I, II, or III stroke centers by the department. This amendment also adds focus reviews to be conducted after an initial review. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in Missouri. Prompt treatment for acute ischemic stroke reduces disability and improves outcomes. Stroke is a sudden brain dysfunction due to a disturbance in brain circulation. The resulting impairments may include paralysis, slurred speech, and vision loss. Getting patients to the stroke centers as quickly as possible is impor- tant to provide stroke patients with medically appropriate care in order to restore blood flow in the brain. There is more damage done to the brain the longer it takes to restore blood flow in the brain. The department began designating hospitals in Missouri as stroke centers in October of 2013. These stroke centers provide a timely and med- ically appropriate focused approach to stroke care that provides patients with better stroke outcomes. During the 2016 legislative ses- sion, section 190.241, RSMo, was amended to add an option for hos- pitals to become designated as stroke centers by the department if the hospitals are certified as stroke centers by the Joint Commission and by other certifying bodies designated by the department. The depart- ment has been working with key stakeholders to identify other stroke certifying bodies that hospitals could be certified with in order to receive a designation from the department without being reviewed by the department. The department has approved DNV-GL Healthcare and Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program as certifying bodies in addition to the Joint Commission whose review is comparable to that conducted by the department. Hospitals were originally desig- nated by the department as stroke centers beginning in October of 2013 by the department. Renewal of these designations will begin in October of 2017 because the designations last for a period of four (4) years. There are currently four (4) hospitals that are designated by the department as stroke centers which also have a certification with the Joint Commission as Comprehensive stroke centers. There are also twenty-four (24) hospitals that are designated by the department as stroke centers by the department which also have a certification with the Joint Commission as Primary stroke centers. Having this rule in effect prior to October 2017, will decrease the expense and staff time and involvement for the department and the hospitals in preparing for reviews by both the department and the Joint Commission for approximately twenty-eight (28) hospitals in Missouri that are designated by the department and certified by the Joint Commission as stroke centers. There are also hospitals in Missouri that have a Joint Commission certification but are not cur- rently designated by the department as stroke centers. As a result of this rule, these hospitals will not have to go through dual reviews with both the department and the Joint Commission. Also, these hospitals 
when designated as stroke centers by the department can begin receiving stroke patients from emergency medical service agencies when the hospitals would not have been able to receive stroke patients prior to the hospital’s designation with the department due to transport protocols. Some of these hospitals are located in more rural areas. This means that patients will be able to be transported to closer hospitals within their emergency medical services area and patients will receive treatment in an even quicker manner. As a result, the DHSS finds an immediate danger to the public health, safety, and/or welfare and a compelling governmental interest, which requires this emergency action. A proposed amendment, which covers the same material, is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. This emergency amendment is limited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The DHSS believes this emergency amendment is fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency amendment was filed August 7, 2017, becomes effective August 17, 2017, and expires February 22, 2018. 
(1) Participation in Missouri’s stroke center program is voluntary and no hospital shall be required to participate. No hospital shall hold itself out to the public as a state-designated stroke center unless it is designated as such by the Department of Health and Senior Services (department). Hospitals desiring stroke center designation shall apply to the department either through the option outlined in sec- tion (2) or section (3). Only those hospitals found [by review] to be in compliance with the requirements of the rules of this chapter shall be designated by the department as stroke centers. 
(2) Hospitals requesting to be reviewed and designated as a stroke center by the department shall meet the following requirements: (A) An application for stroke center designation shall be made upon forms prepared or prescribed by the department and shall con- tain information the department deems necessary to make a fair determination of eligibility for review and designation in accordance with the rules of this chapter. The stroke center review and designa- tion application form, included herein, is available at the Health Standards and Licensure (HSL) office, or online at the department’s website at www.health.mo.gov, or may be obtained by mailing a written request to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, HSL, PO Box 570, Jefferson City, MO 65102-0570. The application for stroke center designation shall be submitted to the department no less than sixty (60) days and no more than one hun- dred twenty (120) days prior to the desired date of the initial desig- 
nation or expiration of the current designation[.]; (B) Both sections A and B of the stroke center review and desig- 
nation application form, included herein, shall be complete before the department will arrange a date for the review. The department shall notify the hospital/stroke center of any apparent omissions or errors in the completion of the stroke center review and designation application form. When the stroke center review and designation application form is complete, the department shall contact the hospi- tal/stroke center to arrange a date for the review[.]; 
(C) The hospital/stroke center shall cooperate with the department in arranging for a mutually suitable date for any announced reviews[.];

physical plant and equipment, and a review of records and documents as deemed necessary to assure compliance with the requirements of the rules of this chapter; 
[(B)]2. A validation review shall occur on a designated stroke center applying for renewal of its designation as a stroke center. Validation reviews shall occur no less than every four (4) years. A validation review shall include interviews with designated stroke cen- ter staff, a review of the physical plant and equipment, and a review of records and documents as deemed necessary to assure compliance with the requirements of the rules of this chapter; and 
[(C)]3. A focus review shall occur on a designated stroke center in which an initial or validation review was conducted and substan- tial deficiency(ies) were cited. A review of the physical plant will not be necessary unless a deficiency(ies) was cited in the physical plant in the preceding validation review. The focus review team shall be comprised of a representative from the department and may include a qualified contractor(s) with the required expertise to evaluate cor- rections in areas where deficiencies were cited[.]; 
[(3)](E) Stroke center designation shall be valid for a period of four (4) years from the date the stroke center/hospital is designated. [(A)]1. Stroke center designation shall be site specific and non- 
transferable when a stroke center changes location. [(B)]2. Once designated as a stroke center, a stroke center may 
voluntarily surrender the designation at any time without giving cause, by contacting the department in writing. In these cases, the application and review process shall be completed again before the designation may be reinstated[.]; 
[(4)](F) For the purpose of reviewing previously designated stroke centers and hospitals applying for stroke center designation, the department shall use review teams consisting of qualified contractors.

The review team shall also consist of at least one (1) and no more than two (2) neurologist(s)/neuro-interventionalist(s) who are experts in stroke care. One (1) representative from the department will also be a participant of the review team. This representative shall coordi- nate the review with the hospital/stroke center and the other review team members. [For a hospital applying to the department as a level I stroke center for an initial review and which provides the department with verification of certification by the Joint Commission as a Comprehensive Stroke Center, the review team shall consist of at least one (1) representative from the department and may also include one (1) qualified contrac- tor. For a hospital applying to the department as a level II stroke center for an initial review and which provides the department with verification of certification by the Joint Commission as a Primary Stroke Center, the review team shall consist of at least one (1) representative from the department and may also include one (1) qualified contrac- tor.] 
[(A)]1. Any individual interested in becoming a qualified con- tractor to conduct reviews shall—

MISSOURI Proposed Rules September 15, 2017 REGISTER Vol. 42, No. 18 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]
