HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMo RULES—Cite material in the Missouri Register by volume and page number, for example, Vol. 28, Missouri Register, page 27. The approved short form of citation 
is 28 MoReg 27. 
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system— Title Code of State Regulations Division Chapter Rule 
1 CSR 10- 1. 010 Department Agency, Division General area regulated Specific area regulated 
They are properly cited by using the full citation , i.e., 1 CSR 10-1.010. 
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division within the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraph 1., subparagraph A., part (I), subpart (a), item I. and subitem a.

Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

This note applies only to the ref- erence material. The entire text of the rule is printed here.

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) received two (2) comments. 
COMMENT #1: State Representative Galen Higdon, Jr., asked to have the substance known as lab number U-47700 added to the list of controlled substances since the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was in the process of scheduling it. This sub- stance is also known as 3,4-Dichloro-N-[(1R,2R)-2-(demethy- lamino)cyclohexyl]-N-methylbenzamide. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: DHSS is autho- rized to update the state list of controlled substances by rule to match the federal controlled substance list pursuant to section 195.015, RSMo. A final order placing 3, 4-dichloro-N-[2-(dimethylamino)cyclo- hexyl]-N-methylbenzamide (also known as U-47700) into Schedule One of the federal controlled substance list was published in the November 14, 2016, Federal Register. Therefore, DHSS is adding this 
substance to paragraph (1)(A)6. of the rule in order to update the state controlled substance list to match the federal controlled substance list. 
COMMENT #2: DHSS staff noted that DEA also recently added N- (1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)-N-phenylfuran-2-carboxamide to the list of controlled substances. This substance is also known as furanyl fen- tanyl. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: DHSS is authorized to update the state list of controlled substances by rule to match the federal controlled substance list pursuant to section 195.015, RSMo. A final order placing N-(1-phenethylpiperidin-4- yl)-N-phenylfuran-2-carboxamide (also known as furanyl fentanyl) into Schedule One of the federal controlled substance list was pub- lished in the November 29, 2016, Federal Register. Therefore, DHSS is adding this substance to paragraph (1)(A)6. of the rule in order to update the state controlled substance list to match the federal con- trolled substance list.

2. Group life insurance or group annuities where there is no direct solicitation of individuals by an insurance producer. Direct solicitation shall not include any group meeting held by an insurance producer solely for the purpose of educating or enrolling individuals or, when initiated by an individual member of the group, assisting with the selection of investment options offered by a single insurer in connection with enrolling that individual in group life insurance or a group annuity. Group life insurance or group annuity certificates marketed through direct response solicitation shall be subject to the provisions of section (7) of this rule; 
3. Group life insurance or annuities used to fund prearranged funeral contracts; 
4. An application to the existing insurer that issued the existing policy or contract when a contractual change or a conversion privi- lege is being exercised; or, when the existing policy or contract is being replaced by the same insurer pursuant to a new policy or con- tract filed with and approved by the director; or, when a term con- version privilege is exercised among corporate affiliates; 
5. Proposed life insurance that is to replace life insurance under a binding or conditional receipt issued by the same company; 
6. (Reserved) A. Policies or contracts used to fund 1) an employee pension 
or welfare benefit plan that is covered by the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (ERISA); 2) a plan described by Sections 401(a), 401(k) or 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, where the plan, for purposes of ERISA, is established or maintained by an employer; 3) a governmental or church plan defined in Section 414, a governmental or church welfare benefit plan, or a deferred com- pensation plan of a state or local government or tax exempt organi- zation under Section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code; or 4) a non- qualified deferred compensation arrangement established or main- tained by an employer or plan sponsor. 
B.

Background 
The individuals listed in this notice have recently filed applications requesting MoDOT to issue SPE Certificates to exempt them from the physical qualification requirements relating to vision in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(10), or to diabetes in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(3), which other- wise apply to drivers of CMVs in Missouri intrastate commerce. 
Under section 622.555, RSMo, MoDOT may issue an SPE Certificate, for not more than a two- (2-) year period, if it finds that the applicant has the ability, while operating CMVs, to maintain a level of safety that is equivalent to or greater than the driver qualifi- cation standards of 49 CFR 391.41. Upon application, MoDOT may renew an exemption upon expiration. 
Accordingly, the agency will evaluate the qualifications of each appli- cant to determine whether issuing an SPE Certificate will comply with the statutory requirements and will achieve the required level of safety. If granted, the SPE Certificate is only applicable to intrastate transportation wholly within Missouri.
